Additionally, the installed fans consume 40kW/h of power, required to blow the hot air through the same amount of laundry. The proposed thermo-vacuum drying method allows intensifying the drying process by pressure and temperature difference that serves to remove the moisture 5-10 times faster than any conventional methods of drying. The operation relies on the heat, produced by the integrated steam boiler, circulating in the closed cycle between the vacuum ejector and the rotary drum.

However, methods have relied on passive approaches with annual storage capacity limited to a single season. Furthermore, the most common materials for energy storage undergo a solid-liquid phase transition, which results in the need for encapsulation. In contrast to conventional energy storage approaches that fail to achieve performance and cost metrics, we propose to develop phase change materials (PCMs) that undergo solid-solid phase change and allows for dynamic tunability of the transition temperature.

The project team will first optimize PCMs from two classes of materials, Polyols and Comb-branch Micro block Polymer (CMP), which undergo solid-solid phase change and optimize their transition temperature.

Finite element simulations showed that the application of thermally anisotropic composites (TACs) could reduce heat gains through walls by 75% or more compared to walls with cavity and exterior insulation; the findings were verified via laboratory experiments on 8’-by-8’ wall sections in a climate chamber. TACs coupled with a heat sink/source is a novel technology that can redirect and reduce unwanted heat flows through the building envelope. This project aims to optimize the design of TAC systems for walls and roofs using lab test results from FY18, running additional lab tests in FY19 and simulation studies.

Performance of the optimized systems will be evaluated in ORNL’s natural exposure test facilities, and the results will be extrapolated through simulation studies using calibrated models to estimate performance under various weather conditions. As a conservative estimate, assuming the application of the anisotropic concept to a fraction of buildings, we can expect 15% reductions in overall energy consumption attributed to walls and roofs. In addition to the energy savings, proposed technology can also shave peak energy demand, and provide resilience in power outages, especially during extreme heat events.",Lab Award,Active

Modern commercial lighting control systems are already difficult to use and maintain, and even with so-called “smart” lighting, optimizing light settings is rapidly exceeding the capabilities of direct human control, limiting the adoption of lighting control systems. The growing importance of occupancy-centric controls (OCC) for advanced building management systems can be applied to the development of autonomous lighting-system controls needed to drive the adoption of advanced lighting controls for improved adaptive “sculpted illumination” for both greater energy savings and broader human wellbeing perspectives. This project will develop and test an entirely new platform for automated optimized lighting design and control that requires little or no human engagement, yet contours lighting profiles automatically to minimize lighting-energy use. The researchers call this approach to lighting control “dynamic light sculpting,” since the right amount of illumination is automatically delivered to occupants in real time. Since the system uses new, privacy-preserving occupant position and pose detection technologies developed for broad OCC building applications, the control system will analyze how to deliver the right amount of the right type of illumination only where and when it is needed, based on these OCC platforms. To create these powerful autonomous lighting control platforms, the project will integrate evolving augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) tools with sophisticated lighting and interior design toolkits to create interactive lighting design and control simulators. Using the quickly growing paradigm of digital twins, these tools will integrate light-fixture properties, occupancy-sensor data, interior-design data, and lighting specifications to accurately visualize how various design concepts interact with simulated yet realistic human activities that occur in commercial office buildings of various types.

To address this, the researchers demonstrate that a new type of optical outcoupling structure can control the lifetime of excitons within a given emissive material. The result paves the way to a new technology for OLEDs. The researchers term it “multifunctional” optical outcoupling, because they seek to extract light from OLEDs and also to engineer stability. The researchers will fabricate a novel plasmonic architecture that improves device stability by decreasing the excited-state lifetime of the emitters without drastically decreasing the light-extraction efficiency. Radiative excited states from phosphors will efficiently transfer energy to surface plasmon modes at a metal dielectric interface. To outcouple the light from the surface plasmon, the researchers will leverage a plasmonic phenomenon known as “extraordinary optical transmission,” wherein constructive interference between propagating surface plasmons dramatically reduces surface plasmon losses and enables transmission of light of up to 50% over ~150 nm bandwidth.

Project innovation around duct sealing seeks to address a significant shortcoming of current construction practices, and innovation with heat pumps seeks to introduce an inherently more efficient technology into this housing segment.

Obtaining consistently tight ducts that maintain their tightness over time—or eliminating the need for ductwork entirely—is a tremendous opportunity for improving the energy performance of MHs.

Modern inverter-driven air source heat pumps are significantly more efficient than older heat pump technology—and vastly more so than the electric-resistance heating that ships with many MHs. They are also capable of operating under much colder conditions than previous generations of heat pumps.

The creation of an easily deployable IMSP that can commercialize and scale up quickly, adapt to a variety of existing conditions, and achieve cost compression at scale, will help unlock a dramatic increase in deep energy retrofit rates across the country. By eliminating the time-conusming, disruptive,  costly, and bespoke  nature of traditional retrofit approaches, there is a potential market of 16.1 million multifamily units and an estimated annual energy savings of up to $4.3 billion in ASHRAE climate zones 3, 4, and 5 alone.

The IMSPs aloneare estimated to reduce site energy use by 27% (29% of heating energy reduction, 18% of cooling energy reduction, and 91% of domestic hot water energy use). If deployed across the targeted multifamily sector, the total technical potential savings is 463.7 Tbtu/yr. IMSPs, however, will not be designed to be deployed alone, but rather as part of an integrated retrofit with building envelope solutions. When integrated with a panelized envelope retrofit, the potential savings is approximately 1,009 Tbtu/yr.",Funding Opportunity,Active

Zero-energy modular (ZEM) homes are emerging as a new housing option; they are quick to build and affordable to occupy. ZEMs combine the benefits of no- to low- monthly energy bills with the cost efficiencies of off-site, modular construction. All-electric and highly efficient, ZEM homes are often outfitted with rooftop solar arrays and use about as much energy as they produce each year. This project will create a ZEM multifamily construction system, including designs for a ZEM factory and ZEM multifamily units. The units’ design will meet DOE’s stretch goal of 50 percent more efficient than code at no additional first cost. The project will also create a ZEM workforce training module. A strong dissemination strategy for all of the deliverables (collectively, a blueprint) will spur growth of a national ZEM market and drive market demand.

The approach includes development of a buried metal mesh to improve conductivity into the OLED device. The fraction of the light generated in OLEDs that is emitted in the forward direction (i.e., the outcoupling factor ηout) is only ~17% to 20% in conventional bottom-emitting OLEDs. This is due to ~50% loss to internal waveguiding in the high refractive index [organics+indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent anode]/air interface plus excitation of surface plasmons at the flat metal cathode. Another ~30% of the light is waveguided through the substrate to its edges. While extracting the latter with a microlens array or a hemisphere is standard practice, recovering the internally waveguided light and mitigating plasmon loss inexpensively remain challenging. To broadly assess the best designs for enhanced light outcoupling, in addition to patterned OLEDs with different corrugation heights, devices, including multi-stack tandem OLEDs, will be fabricated also on substrates semi-flattened by ITO. To minimize trial and error, substrate and OLED designs will be guided by simulations, which will predict the optimal single- and multi-period structures and the maximal achievable ηout.

PROJECT IMPACT
The project’s overall goal is to achieve ηout = 70% in white OLEDs using innovative corrugated light-extraction substrates fabricated in a simple, scalable, and low-cost method that is fully transferrable to roll-to-roll production. The corrugation results in light scattering and diffraction that minimize internal waveguiding by reducing total internal reflection at the [organics+ITO]/air interface and plasmon loss at the cathode.",Funding Opportunity,Active

The platform will be enabled by an integrated development effort with innovations in three key areas. First, the efficacy of high-luminance LEDs will be significantly increased by the development of epitaxy and device architectures optimized for high drive current density, breaking through the tradeoff in efficacy (lm/W) vs. emittance (lm/mm2) exhibited by state-of-the-art products. Second, a compact chip-scale package will be developed that will allow high packing density and thus high overall luminance in multi-emitter arrays. Third, phosphor technology will be developed to enable CCT tuning functionality in multi-emitter arrays with optimized LED utilization, efficacy, color uniformity, and color quality across the CCT tuning range. Directional indoor and outdoor applications make up a major portion of the total lighting energy consumption in the U.S, accounting for >40% of the energy savings potential of solid-state lighting. This project will accelerate the realization of these energy savings through both higher system efficacy and adoption due to new functionality, and thus will contribute significantly to achieving DOE’s SSL performance goals.",Funding Opportunity,Active

A case study will be conducted in a city where adaptive lighting has been fully implemented, and a complete photometric evaluation, a vehicle crash and crime analysis, and focus groups will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the adaptive lighting system. Based on the case study results, a metric will be developed that allows the evaluation of the impacts of adaptive lighting on established measures. After a final evaluation of the metric along with energy consumption and user impacts, the findings will be translated into guidelines and specifications for the application of adaptive lighting in street and residential areas. This project is expected to have significant and immediate impacts on the outdoor lighting industry. The ability to identify the energy impacts of an adaptive lighting system that maintains the safety and security of roadway users will allow agencies and governments to make informed decisions about adaptive lighting systems and provide benefit-cost justifications for those systems. Thus, the results will immediately improve decision-making related to lighting and control systems.",Funding Opportunity,Active

Components of a solid-state luminaire will be fabricated using additive manufacturing methods, including mechanical and thermal management structures, electrical and electronic structures (on three-dimensional representative substrates), and optical and light reflector structures. The team will assemble a complete, additively manufactured, LED-integrated luminaire comprised of these fully integrated components and measure the performance, cost, and manufacturing process impacts relative to a baseline commercial product. The research focuses on addressing the dominant luminaire subsystem cost elements, identified by DOE as the housing, heat sinking elements, electrical connectors, and mechanical fasteners.

Specifically, random corrugated structures are especially ideal for this purpose, because the extracted light profile will be independent of wavelength and angle. Previous DOE-funded research conducted by the team shows that an ideal corrugated structure for light extraction should have an optimized corrugated depth at the metal electrode interface to extract the SPP modes, and a large refractive contrast at the transparent electrode interface to extract the WG modes. To realize OLEDs for general lighting, the researchers will fabricate white OLEDs on random corrugated substrates having an optimized nanostructure and a large index contrast at the ITO interface. The objective is threefold: to develop a continuous roll-to-roll process to produce corrugated substrates that are compatible with large-volume manufacturing; to fabricate OLEDs on random corrugated substrates with a large index contrast at the ITO/substrate interface (Δn ≥ 0.7) to extract the light lost to the SPP modes, and with an optimized corrugated depth to extract the WG modes; and to collaborate with an OLED manufacturer to validate the resulting devices. Previous results show that the team can achieve an external quantum efficiency of 72% in its corrugated green OLEDs. By incorporating a low-index buffer layer on top of a random corrugated glass substrate to enhance the refractive index contrast, preliminary results show that an extraction efficiency of 75% is an achievable target for a fully optimized white OLED.",Funding Opportunity,Active
