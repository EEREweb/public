Commercial Buildings Integration,Energy Efficiency Guides & Program Models,Seventhwave,Accelerate Performance,2016,http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/seventhwave-accelerate-performance,"<p>Weighted Average: 3.24   # of Reviewers: 4</p> 
<p>Relevance: 3.50    Approach: 3.13   Accomplishments: 3.25  Project Collaboration: 3.38   Future Work: 3.25</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Overall, this project was very well regarded by reviewers, who felt that it was well thought out, supported BTO's long term goal of reducing energy use intensity (EUI) in commercial buildings, and provided an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that new buildings can be built to consume 50% less energy than code. Reviewers noted that the project did a good job of simplifying innovation and implementation, and that it wisely leveraged existing energy efficiency programs and their related resources.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that interim goals appeared achievable, though they expressed concern that the project’s energy savings targets were imprecise, potentially rendering progress difficult to track. Reviewers also noted that anticipated energy savings might not materialize until after the 3-year, BTO-funded performance period had closed, suggesting that a longer period of performance may be required for long-term goals to be achieved.</p>
<p>Reviewers highlighted that the project was heavily focused on a critical barrier to energy-efficient commercial construction – namely, that business customers are not asking for high performance buildings, and that energy efficiency is not being considered in new construction until too late in the process – but also pointed out that there were other important barriers which the project failed to address, including financing, measurement and verification, and the long duration between design and measured savings.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, one reviewer was concerned that the project’s solution for the barrier of interest (i.e., tapping utilities to be lead in promoting the project’s procurement model) had its own myriad limitation. This reviewer highlighted that until highly energy-efficient construction was no longer cost prohibitive, it would need to be heavily incentivized; this reviewer found it difficult to believe that utility funding would be able to finance all project activities, recommending that project staff should consider a utility energy services contract (UESC) approach to financing new work where appropriate.</p> 
<p>In terms of partnerships and collaboration, reviewers felt that this was an exemplar project, featuring close collaboration between project staff and energy efficiency programs and other stakeholder in the regions being targeted. One reviewer noted, however, that while stakeholder engagement was particularly impressive in Illinois, additional work remained to gather stakeholders on the ground in Minnesota, Colorado, and Connecticut. In all locations, one reviewer made note of the project’s failure to collaborate with banks and other financial institutions, an activity which could help address financing shortfalls that arise.</p>
<p>Some reviewers thought that the project’s future plans were good, at least within the scope of work presented, but others remained concerned that activities and impacts would need to take place beyond the project’s 3-year period of performance.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>  
<p>Accelerate Performance has produced very promising initial results. Seventhwave has successfully integrated a pipeline of projects and owners in three different, regionally diverse utility territories. Performance-based procurement and utility program development is well underway with regulatory approval moving forward. Problems and barriers with programmatic development are often proactively identified and addressed as the project moves forward. Useful approaches and lessons learned will support replication by in other projects and regions. DOE shares concern with the term of the project considering the length new building construction and the time necessary to verify post-construction performance. However, Seventhwave is progressing ahead of schedule and has met all milestones to date. Resources and practices to support replication will be developed within the three year project timeframe. DOE will be looking for monitoring and verification protocols to support utility program development, as well as regulatory approval of pilot offerings by at least one utility, in the next budget period.</p>"
Commercial Buildings Integration,Technology Demonstration & Deployment,Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator ,SoCal Edge,2016,http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/los-angeles-cleantech-incubator-socal-edge,"<p>Weighted Average: 2.54   # of Reviewers: 4</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed on this project’s relevance to and alignment with BTO goals. However, one reviewer was not clear on what innovation was being introduced by the project’s work plan, and another reviewer was concerned that the project’s premise was based on very broad and unproven assumptions: that a technology which demonstrated energy savings in a U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) demonstration project would perform the same in a different building application.</p>
<p>One reviewer noted that the project team did a nice job of identifying an “on-ramp” market adoption strategy for emerging technologies, but another warned that conducting a handful of pilot projects may not be enough to develop a single ""on-ramp"" process. Furthermore, a reviewer cautioned that if the “on-ramp” strategy cannot reliably deliver predictable energy savings from the commercial buildings it is targeting, its value is low. One reviewer lauded the important barrier being addressed by project’s development of technical specifications for equipment and buildings, but another felt that the project’s activity was modest, and that certain critical barriers were not being considered, notably the potential lack of an installation and servicing network.</p>
<p>Reviewers highlighted that because the project had operated for less than a year, there have not yet been significant accomplishments or impacts. However, they also noted that the project had already met key milestones and appeared on track to meet stated goals and accomplishments.</p> 
<p>One reviewer felt that progress was difficult to assess because the specific technologies being pursued in demonstration project were not identified, while another felt that the project lacked a practical roadmap to accomplish its goals. A frequent reviewer comment was that the planned project timeline of 2 years would be insufficient to complete project activities and accomplish project goals. Finally, a third reviewer noted that the project’s plan (i.e., to identify best-in-class technologies, leverage DOE performance specifications, and engage utility partners to deliver reliable and repeatable energy savings) was a significant undertaking. Being unfamiliar with the project team’s testing, analysis, and deployment expertise, this reviewer was unsure if the project could reliably and repeatedly accomplish its goals.</p>
<p>One reviewer though that the project demonstrated good local engagement, while another highlighted the project’s creative matching of interested and motivated building owners with an incubator of new, innovative technologies. One reviewer did express concern that, for a project focused on leveraging partnerships, the project was not leveraging the Design Lights Consortium's Qualified Products List for light-emitting diode (LED) lighting.</p>
<p>One reviewer thought that the project’s future work plan appeared sound, if not a little ambitious, and identified no major red flags in planned work. However, another reviewer was concerned about the lack of clear metrics for measuring success, while another was not clear on how the project’s planned approach would continue after DOE funding has concluded.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p> 
<p>The objective of SoCal Edge is to create a regional model to increase the conversion of technology demonstrations to larger regional adoption, thus providing local “boots on the ground” to scale up energy savings across regional buildings. Piloting this process includes screening and vetting tools, approaches and developing strategic networks to expand the program's reach, like the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and major building owners. DOE will look for program replicability and sustainability as the project moves forward over the longer term. In the next budget period, the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) and the L.A. Better Buildings Challenge (BBC) will be exploring the benefits of expanding its deployment reach by focusing more engagement with the L.A. Department of Water and Power to use demonstration project results to inform incentive program development. LACI and L.A. BBC will identify the best in class approaches to achieve the project's impact objective: 100 buildings adopting technologies that achieve 20-50% savings per project.</p> "

<p>Relevance: 3.00    Approach: 2.67   Accomplishments: 2.83  Project Collaboration: 2.83   Future Work: 3.33</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was relevant to BTO goals, and that it held significant promise for cutting energy use and peak demand. Furthermore, they remarked that if the project were successful in overcoming the critical barrier posed by buildings managers’ inability to optimize operations of their buildings, the opportunities for improving building energy efficiency will be enhanced, and will result in utility bill cost reductions.</p> 
<p>However, reviewers felt that the project did not demonstrate a strong understanding of barriers to wide-scale implementation, with one reviewer observing that the project team did not acknowledge that many building owners and operators are skeptical about energy savings from an unproven concept. This reviewer noted that having project partner Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) provide monitoring and verification of savings could substantially address this “new concept” barrier, and that bringing utilities on board to offer incentives could also help mitigate “risk adverse” concerns.</p> 
<p>Reviewers commented that the project team identified other barriers that would limit the ability to reach certain building types, including commercial buildings controlled via real estate investment trusts (REIT), but one reviewer explained that this market barrier would only limit future penetration of the technology, not prevent the project’s success. Another reviewer remarked that the project’s current focus on U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) and other government- and university-owned buildings was not representative of the broader commercial building market, and that marketing the project to skeptical building owners on a one-off basis would be more difficult.</p>
<p>Reviewers expressed mixed opinions on progress achieved. One reviewer thought that the project seemed significantly behind schedule, that the schedule appeared to be unrealistic, and that it was unclear what results and impacts would be demonstrated at project end. In contrast, another reviewer felt the project was progressing as planned, but explicitly highlighted the risk posed by the ongoing difficulties integrating project technologies into GSA facilities. Finally, a third reviewer felt that the project had met performance goals identified in the timeline.</p> 
<p>One reviewer felt that the project team demonstrated a good understanding of those stakeholders necessary to move its technology into the market, while another highlighted that the GSA Green Proving Ground and the District of Columbia Department of General Services (DC DGS) were useful partners, but that it was not clear how much these partners were being engaged. Further, this reviewer felt that certain other partners’ roles were entirely unclear.</p>
<p>One reviewer felt that the project’s plan for future work seemed reasonable, but that the planned project schedule would need to be extended given the delays experienced already. This reviewer also thought that the plan to roll out the project to all GSA buildings was well conceived, but felt that it would only be effective if the GSA building data barrier could be resolved. Another reviewer recommended that the project’s best market opportunities were in the healthcare and higher education sectors, given the likely limited penetration into REIT-controlled offices and the current challenge posed by GSA systems.</p>

Commercial Buildings Integration,Technology Demonstration & Deployment,Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships,Commercial Advanced Lighting Control (ALC) Demonstration and Deployment,2016,http://energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/northeast-energy-efficiency-partnerships-advanced-lighting-controls,"<p>Weighted Average: 2.97   # of Reviewers: 3</p> 
<p>Relevance: 3.33    Approach: 3.00   Accomplishments: 2.83  Project Collaboration: 3.17   Future Work: 3.00</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, noting that the project was working to commercialize technologies that BTO had supported for many years through research, development, and demonstration (RD&D). Reviewers commented that the project was advancing a complex and confusing technology, where BTO had correctly identified a need in the market. Reviewers also noted that there was potential for substantial savings in the solid-state lighting (SSL) controls arena, and further that the project was taking some much needed steps in the right direction, but that no one could expect all SSL lighting issues to be solved with this project.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project’s overall approach seemed very sound and well thought out, but warned that barriers to advanced lighting controls were significant and should not be underestimated. Reviewers remarked that the project team had correctly identified market roadblocks and had formulated a good approach to begin moving SSL lighting controls into mainstream utility program offerings. However, one reviewer felt that while the project’s focus on training installers would contribute to increased cost-effectiveness, this reviewer was left wondering how the project would address the high cost of equipment.</p>
<p>In terms of progress, one reviewer thought the project appeared to be running a bit behind, while another thought that the project was making good progress towards its goals. One reviewer noted that while there was a “systems based energy efficiency program offering” that was described as being completed in December 2015, no information was available on the project website; this reviewer was concerned that project outputs were only being made available to project partners and not the broader public and marketplace.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that the project was taking a holistic approach by engaging so many stakeholders in the process, and another remarked on the project’s very broad and impressive group of collaborators, which the reviewer thought was the result of the project team’s success with other technology initiatives in recent years. One reviewer made note that the project team’s pre-existing relationships with manufacturers could be a powerful tool, but cautioned that it remained to be seen how past experiences would translate to advanced controls deployment, which required a systems versus individual product approach. Another reviewer remarked that there appeared to be a large number of utility partners involved, which might help define a course for utility programs to advance SSL controls adoption.</p>
<p>Reviewers thought that proposed future work seemed reasonable, and remarked that completion of pilot training and other energy efficiency programs by the end of 2016 should provide time for analysis of the results before the project end date. However, reviewers did feel that there should be more requirements that project materials be made publicly available, and also recommended that the project team should be sure to focus on control solutions that were incredibly simple and user friendly.</p>

<p>Relevance: 3.00    Approach: 2.50   Accomplishments: 2.50  Project Collaboration: 2.75   Future Work: 2.50</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO goals, and also on the technical potential for project outcomes to achieve significant energy savings, but there was disagreement on reviewers’ expecations for the success of the technology and the ultimate impact of project activities. One reviewer expressed serious concern that market and technical barriers would prevent large-scale adoption of micro-combined heat and power (CHP) technology, thus limiting its impact. Another reviewer was optimistic that the potential and promise of micro-CHP technology was sufficient to drive market adoption, provided certain obstacles could be overcome (e.g. development of a plug-and-play model, ability to cost-effectively meet stringent state-level emissions standards, development of a strong network of installation and servicing contractors); however, even this reviewer highlighted the real threat posed by these obstacles to the project’s success.</p> 
<p>One reviewer felt that the project appeared to be well positioned to contribute to BTO’s interim market goals, but others felt that no significant progress or impact had been made outside of the identification of a few demonstration project sites. Reviewers agreed that opportunities were missed for engaging with key partners and stakeholders who might support or contribute to the project – notably the natural gas industry and relevant engineering, mechanical, electrical trades – and recommended that outreach to these groups be a priority. Reviewers did commend the depth of collaboration with existing partners in the water heater industry, but agreed that partnering with a well-established water heater manufacturer was a mixed-proposition that did not guarantee successful market impact.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that future work plans were at least adequate, with one reviewer noting that future plans did a good job of mitigating risks. However, here too reviewers remarked on the risks posed by certain market barriers and technical obstacles to successful product deployment and wide-scale market adoption.</p>

Commercial Buildings Integration,Energy Efficiency Guides & Program Models,Envision Charlotte ,Envision Charlotte Project,2016,http://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/envision-charlotte-project,"<p>Weighted Average: 3.44   # of Reviewers: 4</p> 
<p>Relevance: 3.75    Approach: 3.63   Accomplishments: 3.38  Project Collaboration: 3.38   Future Work: 3.25</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers described this project as highly relevant to BTO, with one noting that there was a clear and direct link between Envision Charlotte's well-articulated and measurable efforts on one hand and BTO's goals on the other. One reviewer warned that because the project was very targeted to one region, it might be prevented from having a significant dent in BTO’s nationwide objectives; however, this warning was tempered by a note that the project’s replicability could lead to broad impact.</p> 
<p>Overall, reviewers felt that the project was a great model for the reduction of resources by end users, and recommended that the project should share its experience with other cities to help maximize the project’s impact in other parts of the country. In particular, reviewers recommended exchanging notes about their processes with the City of Milwaukee, who is implementing a similar, well-regarded project.</p>
<p>Reviewers felt that the project’s approach was very well thought out and focused on critical market barriers. However, reviewers also noted that the City of Charlotte had the luxury of being home to many forward thinking businesses, which helped the program to both succeed and grow. One reviewer noted that while the project’s design appeared effective, it relied on slightly unproven strategies and did not have a clear plan for scaling. Another reviewer highlighted that the approach was not entirely clear in all aspects, including around how energy efficiency measures would be financed and what occupant engagement strategies would be used.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that progress was being made towards project goals, and expressed every confidence that the project would move ahead as planned. One noted that project activities appeared to be moving well toward BTO performance goals, but that a little “tuning” might be necessary to achieve BTO targets and to scale the project’s activities to other cities. Reviewers felt that all parties involved – including Duke Energy, key city partners, and the University of North Carolina (UNC) – were actively engaged and steadily working towards the project’s goals. One reviewer noted that the project team showed a strong understanding of the diverse networks of city and utility stakeholders, but could do a better job of interfacing with the private sector to drive creative energy efficiency solutions and business models.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that it was too early to know how well the project's proposed future work had been designed, but that efforts appeared to be headed in the right direction. Some concern was noted regarding work on behavioral change, citing that those types of programs are very difficult to apply effectively; reviewers counselled project staff to carefully consider what behavior change can realistically achieve. Another reviewer noted that scalability may be difficult because the approach was tailored to specific building stock, but another noted project’s efforts to expand the program within the city, and that the project’s success was evidenced by Duke Energy wanting to move the program to elsewhere in its service area.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>There was agreement among reviewers that this project was relevant to BTO goals and objectives. However, one reviewer remarked on the modesty of the project’s goals, while another expressed concern that there was not a clear metric – nor any estimate of magnitude – for measuring the project’s contribution toward BTO's energy savings targets.</p> 
<p>Reviewers disagreed on the appropriateness of project’s approach. One reviewer commented that the project’s approach was well thought out, noting in particular that the project did a good job of addressing keys issues involved in financing retail energy efficiency improvements. Another reviewer, however, expressed concern that the project was too limited in scope, did not describe how relevant information would be diffused to retailers outside of the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s (RILA’s) membership, and did not address certain other and important market barriers. A third reviewer was concerned about the lack of specificity on certain approach details, while another noted that the project offered no real innovation, focusing instead on activities that are routinely carried out as part of other BTO projects and programs. One reviewer recommended that the project team consider Strategic Energy Management as a comprehensive framework that participating companies could use for goal setting, and implementing measures over time.</p>
<p>In regards to project accomplishments, one reviewer lauded the project’s success in developing implementation models and securing commitments from its membership, but other reviewers felt that no significant direct program accomplishments were presented, remarking furthermore that RILA was working under the assumption that their implementation models would work without demonstrating that this was true. One reviewer felt that industry partnerships and collaboration were a strength of the project, given how it was bringing together the largest retailers to discuss industry-leading practices. However, another reviewer saw partnerships and collaboration as a weakness, noting that key stakeholders like landlords, contractors, governments, and utilities were omitted from the project’s analysis.</p>
<p>Looking forward, reviewers were mixed on their evaluation of the project’s stated future plans. Some reviewers felt that the project had potential to be influential in this market, expressing that a clear path forward was presented. However, one reviewer stated that project offered little-to-no information on if and how it would build upon the successes of the BTO-funded program, while another was concerned that no explanation was offered on how the project would ensure that diffusion of information and demonstrations would lead to actual energy-savings activities on the part of retailers.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>DOE has requested that RILA report the following metrics for energy projects implemented by retailers where available:</p>
<ul>
<li>energy savings as energy use intensity (EUI) in thousands of Btu per square foot (kBtu/SF) for 12 months before and after a project’s completion;</li>
<li>greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions (metric tons);</li>
<li>number of buildings retrofitted or impacted;</li>
<li>private sector dollars invested in project;</li>
<li>workers trained as part of project; and</li>
<li>jobs created as part of project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building energy use and project information is to be reported to the Building Performance Database if available.</p> 
<p>Implementation Models (i.e., case studies) developed by RILA with market leaders (adidas, Regency Centers, etc.) will be replicated with other retail partners through the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) Climate Corps fellowships. Additional best practices uncovered during these fellowships may also be turned into Implementation Models which can be used during subsequent years of the project by Climate Corps fellows working with retailers.</p> 
<p>Implementation Models are publicly available for all retailers to access through the Better Buildings Solution Center. All project resources will also be publicly available through a Retail Energy Management website to be created as a part of the project. RILA will be sharing outcomes of the initial work with retailers through the EDF Climate Corps fellowships with their membership with the intention to expand adoption of these practices across the industry.</p> "

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers overwhelmingly agreed on this project’s relevance to BTO goals, its approach, its market integration, and its plans for future work. One reviewer went so far as to call this project a “success story for BTO,” based on the project’s strong support of BTO’s goal of reducing building energy use and its success in tackling and overcoming potential installation pitfalls for its technology through forward-looking product design.</p> 
<p>Reviewers referred to the project’s approach as very sound, highlighting in particular the project’s responsiveness to customer and stakeholder input early in the deployment and demonstration process, as well as its focus on critical market barriers. They described the project as having successfully developed a commercially- and retrofit-ready deployable product that was delivering significant energy savings, was reaching strong market penetration in a very short period, and had already obtained UL certification. Reviewers agreed that the project was on time, on budget, and ahead of near term installation targets, and was therefore likely to make a transformative contribution to or exceed the interim market goal.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that project staff demonstrated an excellent understanding of the key stakeholders necessary to move this technology to market. They noted that while there did not seem to be a large group of stakeholders involved, the project was extremely responsive to what worked best for customers, adapting the product offering to make it easier for retrofits and simple installations. Therefore, reviewers concluded that the level of integration and collaboration met the needs to have a very successful project, with strong ongoing market prospects and energy savings.</p> 
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that proposed future work appeared very reasonable and would continue to build upon and substantiate performance and energy savings; they anticipated that the project would thus avoid nearly all potential risks that could impede full deployment of its technology.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers remarked that the project’s energy efficiency upgrade plan for commercial buildings was in exact alignment with BTO’s goals. One remarked, however, that the project's problem statement and direction were relatively open-ended and ambiguous, and recommended that the problem statement be tied directly to specific metric-based goals that linked to BTO targets. Another reviewer observed that the relevance will be on target once the project is a bit more mature, though at the time it was too much in its infancy stages.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project’s approach seemed to be on target, given its early stages, and further that the project was moving in the right direction to get its program off the ground. One reviewer remarked that project staff appeared to have given thought to nearly every potential barrier that could impede progress toward overarching goals. Another noted that the project's design appeared to address the market barriers identified at face value, but that it was difficult to see whether the project was taking clear action toward its objectives. For the age of the project, reviewers felt that project staff had a good base of knowledge and direction, and also that there appeared to be a clear plan for the project to deliver progress toward the relevant goals. However, reviewers felt that it was far too early in its timeline for the project to have had identifiable progress to report.</p>
<p>Reviewers observed that the project has an impressive array of partnerships, and that, as it was early on, it was still engaging others to participate. One reviewer remarked that the project appeared to coordinate well across a large field of stakeholders, and demonstrated an ability to properly utilize stakeholders, as necessary, while leading a process that appeared uncomplicated to its users. Another reviewer felt that once the project was more established and had a proven track record, other businesses would also want to participate.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, reviewers felt that the overall approach to the full project cycle was very thorough, and gave thought to the degree of attention that each step required. One reviewer commented that there had clearly been a lot of good input in the project's design, and that the project team appeared have a clear handle on what the next steps were. However, another noted that the proposal for future work presented only a “broad strokes” vision of what the project should look like, whereas the reviewer would have liked to see more details.</p>
<p>One reviewer recommended that the project team reach out to Envision Charlotte team to have a conversation on lessons learned from Charlotte’s successful program.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>  
<p>Milwaukee will continue outreach through partners, training with auditing tools, and trialing the customer management tool to identify improvements. In the next budget period, DOE will be looking for the establishment of a new work study program and testing of the customer management tool with 30-50 buildings in multiple commercial building sectors.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, noting their expectations that the project’s activities would expand energy efficiency programs, and lead to more efficiency investments in the two pilot cities. One reviewer noted that it might be difficult to attribute city-wide efficiency improvements to this project, highlighting the importance of monitoring and evaluation, while another recommended the project focus more on substantiating any progress made toward its goals. Overall, many reviewers were optimistic about the potential for this project to have a positive impact in New York City, Washington, D.C., and other cities, although a few questioned whether the project’s activities could be effectively replicated across the country.</p>
<p>Reviewers expressed mixed opinions about the project’s approach and accomplishments, though some attributed a negative appraisal to the project’s nascence. Reviewers commented that the project’s activities were a good first step to reduce energy consumption in existing buildings, and that the project was adequately making progress given its early stages. However, reviewers highlighted several concerns about the project’s planned activities, notably that project did not fully or adequately identify market barriers to energy efficiency in the multifamily and commercial buildings sectors, nor did it explain how these barriers would be overcome.</p> 
<p>Other reviewer concerns included that reviewers uncertainty with how the project would make building performance data any more actionable than they already are; whether the toolkit would be effectively disseminated to the proper organizations in other pilot cities;, and – importantly – how energy audits would be completed so as to lead to the completion of energy efficiency retrofits. In regards to the toolkit that will be developed as party of this project, some reviewers felt that its details remained unclear, that no firm implementation plan had been presented, and that there was risk that the toolkit would not be properly distributed.</p>
<p>Reviewers felt that the project was connecting with some of the right people in pilot cities, including government officials and utility providers, but also that some important stakeholders in the private sector were being left out. Though project staff expressed their intention to collaborate with the private sector, reviewers felt that no clear-cut next steps were provided in this regard.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, one reviewer felt that there was a clear path forward for the initial 3 years. However, others remained concerned that, unless incentives were addressed by the project, building owners would likely not take action on their own to reduce energy consumption. Another reviewer stressed that the project needed to clarify how its toolkit would add value over and above the data already collected by energy efficiency programs.</p> 
<p>Reviewers recommended that the project had to effectively share its best practices in order to help other cities jump start their own programs, and also that the project should focus its deliverables according to target markets, noting that officials in different cities need very different resources and solutions.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>Given some of the challenges that were expressed by the reviewers, the project will likely include a new Go/No-Go decision point to encourage incremental progress in both the development of the toolkit and the articulation of the value that this data can provide to program implementers. Steps will be taken to gather feedback on the toolkit throughout the duration of the project, leveraging new and existing networks through DOE and the Institute for Market Transformation (IMT), will support the effort to distribute and implement the final version of that toolkit that will provide an easily replicable solution for cities looking to gain value through leveraging their data resources.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goal, remarking that project deliverables filled a clear need in the market and provided a tool that would help boost the energy-efficiency-improvement economy. One reviewer expressed reservations about the number of existing credentials that may already meet market needs, but even this reviewer acknowledged the project’s value-add.</p>
<p>Several reviewers felt the project had successfully identified a key market barrier (i.e., the lack of national guidelines for energy-related professional credentials), and agreed that the project's approach was appropriate for addressing market needs. However, one reviewer was concerned that many barriers discussed were barriers to building energy efficiency rather than barriers to workforce development, and that the project had moved forward assuming that development of new workforce guidelines would have a conclusive and significant impact. Another reviewer expressed concern over the assumption that accredited workers save energy, noting that this claim should be validated and widely communicated to overcome skepticism in the construction industry. A third reviewer would have liked to hear more specifics on the market demand for workers in this field, to get a better understanding of the future job market for workers trained for clean energy jobs.</p>
<p>One reviewer felt that the project had met key milestones, and had identified long term outcomes which appeared achievable, while another had no concerns about the project team’s ability to meet its goals. In contrast, one reviewer commented that the project’s achievements had made little progress toward meaningful program-level goals, and was concerned that the project should have had more concrete progress to report as it neared its end. Another reviewer projected that the project had a greater likelihood of supporting BTO program goals in the future, once the first group of workforce professionals were trained. Finally, one reviewer recommended that the project team develop metrics to measure the success of their workforce training once it was implemented.</p>
<p>In terms of collaboration, reviewers remarked on the project’s success in reaching out to key public and private sector stakeholders, and on its effective coordination with existing credentialing programs. One reviewer would have appreciated more detail on the project’s collaboration with its stakeholders, particularly its collaboration with government agencies. Another reviewer was concerned that no major architecture, engineering, and/or construction firm was represented on the project’s board of advisers, believing that designers were critical to engaging educated professionals on a construction site.</p>
<p>Looking forward, one reviewer felt that the barriers that remained had been identified, and another felt that most of the project’s difficult tasks were complete. However, one reviewer was concerned about the project team’s ability to complete its work and provide enough support to partners to carry on the work beyond the funding period. Another reviewer recommended that the project team prioritize its efforts to educate others about the certification and its associated titles, as organizations that are unaware of the certification will not put enough emphasis on these titles.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>Since the Peer Review, two additional certifications have received DOE recognition: Certified Energy Auditor from the Association of Energy Engineers and the Certified Commissioning Professional from the Building Commissioning Certification Board. Work is also underway to create a certificate program for a Better Buildings Workforce Guidelines (BBWG) job - the Building Operations Professional (BOP). The subject matter experts (SME) committee has been formed and the Board has been organized. Scales for each task and knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) for the BOP has been developed. The scales have been provided to SME for review and validation. Finally, a survey has been developed and disseminated to stakeholders in the industry regarding the BOP.</p> "

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, recognizing the deployed technology’s potential to reduce HVAC energy use while improving indoor air quality (IAQ). However, they expressed concern that technical issues could limit market adoption, and therefore the project’s potential impact on energy use. These technical concerns included that the sorbent material’s ability to perform reliably over its useful life was unknown, that the process for integrating the technology into most existing building control systems had not been well defined, that the installation and servicing network has not been well defined, and that the need for an exhaust vent for the air flush could be an impediment in many otherwise appropriate applications.</p>
<p>One reviewer remarked that there appeared to be a strong technical team in place, and a good product with significant energy savings potential, but that understanding of the real and substantial market barriers to getting beyond a very small number of pilot projects was not demonstrated. This reviewer observed that the first pilot installation appeared to be delivering substantial savings, but expressed concern that there also seemed to be significant installation and practical barriers to wider acceptance and use of this new technology. Despite these concerns, reviewers acknowledged that, though slightly behind schedule as of the time of this Peer Review, the project did have one system successfully installed, and appeared to be on track to monitor system performance, analyze the energy savings, overall economics, verify IAQ improvement, and achieve its interim market goal.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted that the project’s linkage with utilities and Johnson Controls was useful, but also that it seemed that many more partners and case studies would be needed to get beyond niche market penetration. As mentioned previously, reviewers felt that development of an installation and servicing network was also lacking, noting that project success would require relevant trades to be engaged and encouraged to accept this technology. One reviewer expressed a desire to see a roadmap for the installation and servicing of this technology.</p>
<p>Reviewers acknowledged that the project’s future plans called for addressing some technical concerns, which would contribute to increased technology cost-effectiveness and wider applicability. However, while they felt that the outlined technical work seemed appropriate, reviewers thought that more work was needed on market assessment, barriers, and a realistic commercialization plan, given that this was a demonstration and deployment project.</p>
<p>Reviewers recommended that the project could benefit from having a market research analyst help to identify barriers to wider market acceptance, which seemed critical to move toward any significant market penetration. They also recommended planning now for the installation and servicing network, as well as surveying various code jurisdictions across the country to be sure that the technology did not run afoul of some jurisdictions that limited the project’s ability to flush the pollutants to the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals. One reviewer remarked that the project was well positioned to provide valuable measurement and verification (M&V) of energy efficiency improvements, while another described the project as critical to the success of BTO's overall goals and the energy efficiency market at large. However, reviewers also pointed out that while savings verification are core to BTO program goals, this project’s tool would not directly produce energy savings, and therefore would not directly contribute to BTO's quantitative performance targets.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project’s approach addressed a significant market barrier (i.e. skepticism of building owners about investments in energy efficiency measures), with one reviewer describing the project as being “laser-focused” in this regard. Other reviewers remarked that the project’s approach seemed reasonable and valid. Reviewers agreed that the project had been successful in solving technical issues related to its objective. However, they expressed concern about how the project’s outputs would be adopted or seeded into the community in a manner that supported longer term functionality, and recommended that the project team focus more on the infrastructure and support networks required to see this work continued.</p> 
<p>Another point of reviewer concern focused on the question of uncertainty, noting that if the project team wanted to see successful future deployment of the tool, they would need to help bound the maximum level of acceptable uncertainty in energy-savings M&V.</p>
<p>Reviewers made note that, to date, the project’s progress was in line with its goals, commenting specifically that the project had demonstrated achievement of near term goals and was well positioned to deliver intermediate goals. However, reviewers expressed concern regarding the project’s ability to achieve its long term goals. This concern revolved around the two issues referenced above: (1) whether the team will provide formal guidance on the acceptable level of uncertainty for M&V tools; and (2) whether the team can find a permanent solution for sustaining its project deliverables beyond the project period.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that the project team demonstrated good understanding of market players and the M&V tools available, and engaged in significant collaboration with an impressive list of partners, including proprietary tool developers, industry stakeholders, utilities, and end users. However, one reviewer questioned why regulatory stakeholders did not have a formal collaborative role earlier in the process.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team presented a logical and achievable set of tasks for the future, with some commenting that momentum existed to carry the project forward. However, other reviewers thought that next steps were unclear, that some risks were not fully considered, and that the future of the project’s tool had some uncertainty, because an appropriate entity had not been identified to whom stewardship of the project’s deliverables could be transferred. One reviewer felt the project team appeared focused on tying up these questions, however, and expected the team to be successful.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, remarking that it provided a critical resource and key infrastructure tool that allowed for the free-market development of applications, strongly supported performance-based building design and transaction approaches, and helped a range of stakeholders to effectively understand and incorporate the value of energy efficiency into the commercial building market. Several reviewers noted that the concept of “market barriers” was not as applicable to this project, as the project represented an ongoing effort to continually improve a piece of energy modeling software for which market barriers to its adoption and use were long ago identified and overcome.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted that the project team had a clear way of organizing its work flow to focus on bug fixes, user requests, and longer-term developments, and that the project team continued to focus its workflow on those features that the industry found useful. However, reviewers did identify a few features they felt were missing from the tool, including a lack of design-decision support tools dedicated to net zero energy commercial buildings and a lack of focus on high-impact technology applications.</p> 
<p>One reviewer felt that the project’s deliverables have significantly contributed to BTO’s impact goals, commenting that continued support, improvement, and expansion of the tool was one of the critical functions that DOE has provided over the years. Another reviewer felt that, by widely supporting other DOE programs, this project’s accomplishments would ultimately be a great deal more than the sum of all direct applications of the tool. Regarding this impact, however, reviewers expressed a desire to see more measurement and reporting efforts, commenting that it was difficult to directly relate project outcomes to BTO’s quantitative goals and performance targets.</p> 
<p>Reviewers thought it was clear that the project team collaborated with an extensive network of DOE and external stakeholders, with one reviewer remarking that no stakeholders appeared to have been omitted. While the stakeholders were well known, however, reviewers would have liked to hear more about the many roles played by these stakeholders in the development of the project’s tool. One reviewer also felt that some thought should be given to the needs of end-users of derivative products built from the tool, a function that was currently being left to third-party developers. Another recommended that the project might consider pursuing increased industry cost share, given its slew of successful partnerships.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with the project’s future plans for new features and updates for the tool, and also remarked that the project team appeared to have clearly thought out its method for prioritizing its work. However, one reviewer thought that future work was not spelled out with sufficient detail, while another thought that future plans should prioritize efforts to identify cross-over functionality between the project deliverable and other major tools (e.g., Asset Score).</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>OpenStudio is a long-running foundational DOE project that will continue for the foreseeable future. The project is laser-focused on software industry needs and collaboration with industry and other stakeholders (e.g., utilities, state energy agencies) will continue to be an important aspect of the project.</p>
<p>It is difficult to attach traditional performance metrics (i.e., the types of metrics that are attached to physical widgets such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and windows, in particular, installed cost and lumens-per-watt or U-value) to software projects as well as to account for energy savings. Rather for software, DOE focuses on deployment and use metrics. Current DOE metrics for OpenStudio (and EnergyPlus) use AIA 2030 Commitment reporting data to measure use in design and energy savings over code-baseline. DOE will investigate other potential metrics and sources of data for tracking OpenStudio use.</p> 
<p>Suggestion for alternate peer review structure for EnergyPlus (and maybe other large long-standing projects) is well taken and will be considered for implementation next year.</p> "

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project was relevant to BTO’s goals, with multiple reviewers remarking that the project was either critical to achieving the goals or would have a significant impact on BTO’s ability to achieve its goals. Reviewers believed that the project team adopted a good approach to the development of the Asset Score tool, and liked in particular the tool’s simplified interface; its flexibility to operate with rudimentary information or with additional, increasingly precise inputs; and, its ability to identify efficiency-improvement opportunities based on the user-defined energy performance of a building.</p>
<p>Reviewers thought that the market barriers the project aimed to address were useful and relevant, and that the project appeared to be working towards appropriate solutions. However, one reviewer thought that the project was failing to address certain barriers related to the usefulness of the tool which could prevent key stakeholders from adopting it. In addition, while reviewers acknowledged that this the tool was different than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager tool, reviewers were concerned that differences were not immediately obvious; reviewers recommended coordinating closely with EPA to appropriately market the different tools.</p>
<p>While reviewers identified a number of the tool’s features and technical accomplishments to illustrate progress to date, many reviewer comments focused on the future of the project. At worst, reviewers warned that this tool could become just another optional assessment tool for government buildings. At its best, however, reviewers remarked on the tool’s potential to transform the real estate market. One reviewer described the tool’s potential to significantly impact the BTO’s performance goals, but only if it were to reach enough of the market; this reviewer expressed concern that the project’s target of reaching only 1% of commercial buildings by 2020 was too low.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project team demonstrated a deep understanding of key stakeholders in the market, noting that the project was working with the proper stakeholders and using them very effectively. One reviewer lauded the project team for creating a complex tool with a great deal of consultation and collaboration, though another reviewer commented that it was difficult to identify how close the level of collaboration was with different stakeholders. One reviewer referred to the project’s partnerships and collaborations as a good start, but thought that more outreach was needed, including with larger real estate companies.</p>
<p>In terms of future work, reviewers thought the project’s work plan would add functionality to the tool and be effective at overcoming current market barriers. However, while some reviewers felt that the project was poised to overcome obstacles related to technical implementation, others felt that the project team did not sufficiently identify potential technical risks. In addition, one reviewer thought that the project team should focus more on working with key industry stakeholders to ensure the tool was meeting these stakeholders’ needs. Another reviewer recommended that the project team focus more on increasing the tool’s connectivity and integration with other DOE tools (e.g., the Standard Energy Efficiency Data (SEED) Platform and Buildings Performance Database).</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers gave this project, on average, moderately good scores, judging it to embody a good idea with a solid plan from which a lot could potentially be learned. Reviewers commented that good progress has been made to date. One reviewer suggested that the absorption system should be evaluated as a viable option for residential applications. Reviewers also stated that the project was relevant to BTO’s goals, in particular, doubling the water heater energy factor from the current 0.62 to 1.3.</p> 
<p>One reviewer noted that there is a substantial existing water heater market for which this technology can be deployed given that there are currently no gas-fired water heat pumps on the market. A reviewer commented favorably on the use of a membrane-based absorption technology, but another expressed concern about the size of the system and cost, noting that the project team did not compare the design to those that are presently on the market or soon will be, nor did the team show a schedule.</p> 
<p>The project scored well on accomplishments and progress, with one reviewer noting the team has developed capabilities to measure a range of criteria (e.g., thermal conductivity, capacity, heat of absorption, density, viscosity, etc.) and another one observing that a demonstration has been built with an energy factor of 1.2 having been achieved. This reviewer also listed as a project strength the development of ionic liquids and other absorption technology. However, a third reviewer said that while good progress has been made, it would be a surprise if the project team completed the work by November since this is a complicated flow system with complicated heat transfer processes.</p> 
<p>Regarding collaboration and integration, one reviewer noted that there was no mention of industry collaboration but only “continual” communication. Another reviewer expressed concern over the lack of manufacturers involved in the project because absorption systems for residential applications are generally not well-received owing to size, cost, and complexity.</p> 
<p>While proposed future work was generally viewed favorably – with one reviewer calling it “logical and on track” in the steps to be completed, another reviewer said the schedule is “overly ambitious” given the November end date.</p> 
<p>Reviewers recommended more industry involvement, as well as an HVAC company, in order to provide useful inputs on practical constraints on cost and size targets before the design gets too far along.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers differed in their opinions on this project’s relevance to BTO’s overarching goals. On one hand, some reviewers expressed that this project’s work represented a very innovative attempt at merging measured data with modeled data, supporting BTO's goals by helping practitioners estimate and implement energy conservation measures more accurately and effectively. On the other hand, some reviewers noted that BTO’s ultimate goal was to provide substantial reductions in energy consumption, where these reviewers felt that the project’s potential for substantial energy saving was questionable.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed on the appropriateness of the project’s approach. One reviewer commented that the project team was employing well-established methods and processes to solve a clearly understood problem. Another reviewer noted that using Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL’s) FLEXLAB for model and simulation validation was a significant step forward in energy modeling, and that overall the strategies presented made sense and were valid. A third reviewer highlighted that the project recognized that energy modeling practices needed more accuracy in the descriptions of buildings’ physical characteristics and operations, and was working to help reduce the differences between model estimates and measured values, beginning with infiltration and thermal mass.</p> 
<p>Reviewers identified some deficits in the project team’s approach, including that it did not provide techniques for integrating the proposed hybrid modeling with existing design tools, and also that it failed to identify how to isolate the specific uncertainties of infiltration and thermal mass from other potential sources of uncertainty. One reviewer recommended that the project could be improved by extending the testing of the hybrid modeling approach to a real world/as-constructed building, and also that it was important for the project to identify what type of standardized and BTO-advised building data collection, storage, and model integration techniques would be needed to facilitate the proposed modelling process.</p>
<p>One reviewer highlighted the project’s demonstration of a two-step validation approach – using prototype models and EnergyPlus followed by field validation via FLEXLAB – as a clear accomplishment, identifying the approach as one that should be used by all researchers investigating improvements to EnergyPlus.</p> 
<p>Beyond this approach, however, reviewers expressed mixed feelings about the project’s potential impact. One reviewer felt that once tested and implemented, the project’s hybrid modelling approach could lead to significant energy savings by enabling existing-building retrofit analysis. In contrast, a different reviewer expressed doubts about the project's estimation of energy savings potential, recognizing how difficult it is to make accurate estimations for modeling tools. One reviewer believed that the project would contribute significantly to achieving the Emerging Technologies (ET) Program's interim market goal, but a different reviewer though that contributions to the ET Program’s interim market goals would be marginal, due to the hybrid approach adding complexity to the current workflow of energy model development and calibration.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project team had pursued appropriate and effective collaborations, but also identified additional stakeholders to whom outreach would be valuable. One reviewer expressed that the project team had done an exceptional job of working with collaborators, including the EnergyPlus team, while another highlighted the value of the project’s collaboration with FLEXLAB.</p> 
<p>However, reviewers noted certain deficits, including that there had been little discussion around collaboration with potential end users to better understand their restrictions and workflow expectations. One reviewer observed that the project’s collaboration with the California Energy Commission (CEC) PIER (Public Interest Energy Research) demonstrated the project team’s basic understanding of key stakeholders, but another reviewer recommended that the project should collaborate with stakeholders outside of California to develop impact. A third reviewer highlighted that collaboration with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) should be pursued around the integration of EnergyPlus with OpenStudio.</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with the project's next steps, with one reviewer describing them as simple, relevant, and on point. Another reviewer expressed that proposed future work was not particularly creative or innovative, but allowed that the nature of the project did not leave room for doing much more than integrating the approach with EnergyPlus and disseminating findings. One reviewer noted that the project team’s future plans failed to highlight technical risks or risk mitigation strategies, while other reviewers recommended developing a framework to get possible industry partners to deploy the hybrid approach and prove user acceptance, as well as instructional/educational resources.</p> 
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>This is a successful research project that will be integrated into EnergyPlus before the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 and into OpenStudio in FY 2017 and FY 2018. The goal of the project was to allow EnergyPlus to leverage increasingly available outside data sources--specifically time series indoor temperature data from smart thermostats--to improve modeling of existing buildings. Initial results were quite positive and additional testing will be done in FY 2017, especially in the context of calibration algorithms. OpenStudio Server provides a natural deployment channel and will make this feature available to EnergyPlus client applications.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, noting that this project presents one of the key technologies of the BTO portfolio. Reviewers unanimously agreed on the high value of project deliverables, noting that technological challenges were resolved, favorable economics established, and pre-commercial testing started.</p> 
<p>Reviewers praised the progress made with electrochemical conversion (ECC) technology on both the analytical and experimental fronts resulting from this project, as membranes and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are now commercially available and have superior performance to competing off-the-shelf products. One reviewer referred to the “game changing” nature of the ECC technology and suggested such a water heating system could complement solar-powered systems since both use low voltages and the latter already has appropriate hardware to generate higher voltages required for household operations.</p>
<p>Reviewers concurred that this project successfully identified and addressed critical market barriers in areas such as component cost, long-term performance, and system integration. They were also impressed with the close collaboration with key market players as evidenced in the work with GE and other key stakeholders in the water heating market.</p> 
<p>A number of reviewers were concerned about the long-term performance of the vacuum system’s hermetic seals, finding that this needs to be evaluated under operating conditions, especially given the presence of non-condensable gas. One reviewer remarked that the resilience of the heretically-sealed vacuum system to contamination – especially when operating below ambient pressure – and air fouling need to be addressed. In particular, because cyanogen gas may be produced at the electrodes, one reviewer recommended that the project team should engage the certification agency in the pre-commercial design and testing process in order to help prevent subsequent follow-on design adjustments by manufacturers. Another reviewer noted that the technology has not been considered as a retrofit for current (conventional) systems.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers remarked that the gradient index substrate used in this project is a potential improvement to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting, which in turn would help the solid-state lighting (SSL) market. They also commented that the higher light extraction efficiency (70%) is well-aligned with BTO’s objectives and the DOE solid-state lighting program’s roadmap. Reviewers liked the project’s approach, including its use of stable scatter/nanocomposite formulation that promises low-cost manufacturing and for overcoming a well-defined technical barrier involving light extraction efficiency.</p> 
<p>One reviewer observed that there have been some deviations from the original project plan involving computations and simulations early in the project timeline. This reviewer stated that while this hasn’t stymied progress, it raises the issue of whether the lack of computation has affected the current formulation for creating an optimal gradient index layer. The reviewer wondered which of the partners was tasked with providing computational results and said that the critical importance of modeling and computations prior to implementation is such that it would be useful to know which computations were not done and why – and how to correct this.</p> 
<p>Reviewers thought the project was progressing well, although one reviewer said it was difficult to judge overall progress because so little data was presented, including how far along the team was in reaching the 70% light extraction efficiency goal. One reviewer pointed out that the team was close to accomplishing a key goal – development of a 4-inch device with 2.9X light extraction – and wondered how that number was selected and if it would be revised upward.</p> 
<p>However, these reviewers acknowledged that there are likely intellectual property (IP) issues at play that made it difficult for the principal investigator (PI) to provide more details. They suggested a closed-door review might be helpful in getting the PI to discuss information more freely without worrying about the presence of competitors. Reviewers praised the project as having good commercial prospects thanks to the processes it is developing and the work with key partners. During the question and answer (Q&A) session, the PI explained the project team is using a natural diffusion process to generate a gradient-index (GRIN), which prompted one of the reviewers to subsequently comment that this approach seems manufacturable.</p> 
<p>Reviewers recommended that the project team look into roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing and have more experimental computations for benchmarking purposes.</p> 
<p>Program Response:</p> 
<p>Pixelligent will continue this project on the stable nanocomposite formulation to enhance light scattering in OLEDs (a key barrier for OLED technology), and the related low-cost manufacturing process.

<p>Reviewers strongly agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, describing the project’s objective of developing new bio-based phenolic foam thermal insulation materials as being well aligned with both BTO’s goal to improve buildings’ energy efficiency and the Windows and Building Envelope Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the appropriateness of the project’s approach, with one reviewer describing the approach as reasonable, and another noting that clear project goals had been developed as a result of the project team’s experience and solid understanding of the technical issues involved. Reviewers described that critical barriers had been identified, and that the project team was employing a comprehensive approach to address these challenges. One reviewer did highlight a few limitations of the approach, however, specifically noting that the level of thermal conductivity of the proposed foam – a key parameter to be addressed – had not been defined, and that a cost per square foot metric for the proposed foam materials had not been proposed. Some additional activities that this reviewer would have liked to see were validation of the findings, the introduction of error analysis, and a clear identification of whether the foam used in the project had isotropic or anisotropic properties.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, reviewers applauded the progress being made by the project team, with reviewers commenting that the project had met all key milestones and had made meaningful contributions to the field with clear achievements. One reviewer said that the potential market impact of this project was evident, while another highlighted that the project’s six patent applications demonstrated its level of accomplishment.</p> 
<p>Reviewers described the project team as well balanced, and commented that it had built strong communications with key stakeholders to accelerate movement of its proposed technology. Reviewers further described that the project had demonstrated good collaboration with industry actors, including manufacturers, research organizations, and consumer groups, and highlighted that this strong connection with industry would enable the transfer of technology from the lab to the market.</p>
<p>Reviewers described the proposed future work as well planned, meaningful, and built on past progress with a focus on making the product marketable as quickly as possible. Despite this overall assessment, however, reviewers identified several possible improvements that the project team could implement, including introducing and verifying a plan for measuring the thermal properties of the produced foam materials, and considering the foam’s level of fire resistance and durability. One reviewer also expressed a desire for more information on patent applications and intellectual property issues, while another would have liked to see techno-economic analysis that addressed the cost target.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p> 
<p>Consistent with the comments from the reviewers, this project is progressing well. The PI will be continuing to characterize the foam in the final months of the project. Concerns from the reviewers regarding foam anisotropy and bulk thermal conductivity can be addressed as part of that work.</p> "

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that, by providing commercial buildings with additional capability for building energy savings – particularly in small and medium-sized commercial buildings – this project was well aligned with BTO’s goals. In contrast to the project’s relevance, however, reviewers appeared split on the project’s approach, its progress and accomplishments, and its collaborations.</p> 
<p>For its approach, some reviewers commented that the project’s energy management system appeared to be moving forward, that the software platform offered good attention to interoperability, and that the project team’s composition allowed it to focus on both market conditions and product development. However, one reviewer felt that the energy management software’s reliance on a hardware platform was a questionable decision, and another thought that the project team had misidentified the critical market barrier as the ""inability to communicate"" between devices, whereas the actual barrier was ""too many languages for one platform to communicate to all"" or ""the refusal by some devices to communicate."" This reviewer also thought that the project team had pushed “openness” as the project’s innovation, whereas the reviewer thought that the device-driver portion of the project was most important.</p> 
<p>In terms of progress and accomplishment, one reviewer felt that the project had good management, leadership, and had experienced excellent project execution; while another reviewer thought that the project’s accomplishments were good overall, but thought that the project team should have focused on finalizing the software before field testing it in three buildings. In contrast, a third reviewer commented that the project team’s demonstration of what could be done with the system was very rudimentary, noting also that the team had done a poor job of differentiating the project’s software from existing open-protocol systems.</p>
<p>Some reviewers felt that the project had pulled together a great team of collaborators, and thought that the compatibility of the project’s energy management software with DOE’s VOLTTRON platform was a positive sign. However, some reviewers felt that the project’s integration with commercial companies needed attention, particularly because the project team discussed needing to spin off a company to upkeep the platform. In addition, reviewers commented that the project’s need to spin off a company was indicative that the effort was not really any different from other startups in home automation or building control systems.</p> 
<p>Reviewers were in general agreement that the project’s proposed future work was lacking. One reviewer commented that they were apprehensive about the future work, while another noted that while adding Demand Response functionality was a positive development, concerns remained about the cost of the energy management service compared to other systems already in production. Finally, another reviewer commented at length regarding the project team’s apparent belief that the job was done following completion of the integration platform; this reviewer believed that even if a company were spun off to keep the software going, the project team was underestimating the actual software development required, including around energy management and control logic and maintaining interoperability with a range of devices over time.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>While reviewers were intrigued by this energy recovery ventilator (ERV) technology integrated directly into a building’s envelope (as wall components) rather than within a central HVAC system, they repeatedly expressed real reservations about the likelihood of widespread market penetration. Reviewers cited the enormous architectural and mechanical issues that would have to be addressed before such a technology would be widely accepted. They also expressed concern about the likely higher cost of manufacturing an array of ERV panels as wall components and questioned why such a technology would be better than centralized ERV integration within a building’s HVAC system.</p> 
<p>Among the technical issues that reviewers raised about this ERV technology was the relatively high pressure drop through the units and the effect on market acceptance as a result of fan noise caused by the high air flow of 200 cubic feet per minute (cfm) through the units. (During the question and answer (Q&A) session, the presenter said the goal was to reach 300 cfm). Another reviewer commented that it was not clear whether performance deterioration would occur as a result of particulate deposition from the air streams and, if so, how this would be cleaned.</p> 
<p>It was also noted that this wall component-based ERV technology would be more effective in warm and humid climates rather than colder climates. (During the Q&A session, the presenter stated the focus has been on climates where there is a need for dehumidification). A reviewer commented that it was difficult to see how this technology could achieve sufficiently high performance and market penetration to meet BTO goals. These concerns were compounded by the fact that the project is due to conclude soon without having addressed these issues.</p> 
<p>Reviewers were pleased with the amount of collaboration and coordination with stakeholders in academia and industry since the radical nature of this new ERV approach represents a challenge to its acceptance.</p> 
<p>The project received its highest marks on proposed future work given that this involves demonstration of manufacturing the units at target cost, completing needed product certifications, and building a sales pipeline. One reviewer suggested the principal investigator (PI) work directly with a hands-on designer and construction crew to explore actual implementation details. Another reviewer concurred, saying that such real-life testing will be critical to determine if this ERV technology will be successful, especially at the office building scale.</p>

<p>Relevance: 3.86    Approach: 3.00   Accomplishments: 2.93  Project Collaboration: 3.50   Future Work: 2.86</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers found this project to be highly relevant to BTO’s building energy efficiency goals and they favorably judged its approach in identifying critical market barriers. However, a number of reviewers expressed concern that the project had too much focus on a marketing and business model to promote the certification and rating system for window attachments and a lack of a well-grounded technical approach required to develop such a system. At issue is the need to have a standard method to evaluate, rate, and compare window attachment product performance. One reviewer attributed the slippage of project goals to the difficulty of achieving consensus in a fragmented industry.</p> 
<p>Several reviewers expressed concern that the project has yet to realize the necessary technical achievements to create a methodology that makes the certification program a reality. Instead, they noted, the achievements have focused on forming an organization and outreach to stakeholders to increase awareness of window attachments as an energy savings measure. One reviewer expressed concern that the ultimate goal of the project – launching a certification program – could take some time.</p> 
<p>Reviewers gave the project high marks for integration and collaboration, remarking favorably on the strong and diverse public-private collaborative efforts bringing together manufacturers, public interest groups, and others. In terms of weaknesses, reviewers pointed to the challenges of developing a nationally effective organization and lack of a technical approach and methodology to date for a certification that would allow for better targeted marketing and solutions.</p> 
<p>Looking ahead to project future work, reviewers said the planned publicly-available website and database would be of great value. However, owing to the lack of specific steps for technical effort, one reviewer said there is a need for testbeds or small pilot projects to help verify and improve the certification system. Other reviewer recommendations were to conduct simulation modeling and experimental testing to ascertain and compare product performance and to bring the technology team more actively into the project.</p> 
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>The primary weakness identified by the reviewers centers on the lack of a technical approach for the rating system. While it is well-taken that the presentation by the Window Covering Manufacturers Association (WCMA) would have benefited from a discussion regarding the method by which the technical approach is being developed, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) is principally responsible for that aspect of the project and presented separately at the Peer Review on its work plan and achievements thus far. LBNL’s scope of work includes many of the activities (e.g., modeling and empirical evaluation/validation) that reviewers identified as important to the development of a robust certification and labeling methodology.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers found the project aligned with BTO’s goals, although several wondered if the project’s impact statement was too ambitious for such an early stage project and questioned the realism of the 50% penetration and resulting energy savings by 2025. Reviewers pointed to a large number of potential barriers facing the project, including material selection, cost reduction, and design adjustment of the “roller-belt” (including tension, compression, rollers, rods, etc.).</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted the extensive work on this technology conducted under DOE’s Advanced Research Projects Agency- Energy (ARPA-E) from 2010 to 2015 resulting in the filing of a provisional patent. The project is currently working on a Generation V prototype with simulation and testing already performed. Reviewers noted the project team appeared to have a solid understanding of the physical mechanisms and principles associated with membrane-based thermal and mass transport. Reviewers noted the project team was small at this point, but the collaboration appeared to be strong and well-defined. Reviewers recommended partnership with commercial partners, one suggested a materials supplier and another original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or HVAC manufacturers, to provide cost-favorable design insights.</p>
<p>Reviewers warned of the challenges associated with measurement accuracy (particularly concerning brush thermocouples), measurement protocols, thermal capture (including parametrical optimization), the cost of materials at scale, and risk mitigation, with a few reviewers remarked the team appeared to be well aware of them and has a realistic assessment in the complexities involved in bring the technology to maturity. One reviewer recommended quantitative demonstration of the coefficient of performance (COP) would be helpful to convince others this technology is a viable path forward, with another noting the performance of preliminary laboratory systems appeared to be lower than the level expected for the target performance. Another felt that more discussion of the challenges involved in scaling up this technology would be useful; 1 kilowatt (kW) cooling power is still too small to be relevant, but scaling it up by a factor of ten in a cost effective way is a big step whose feasibility the project team should address.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that improving efficiency in clothes dryers represents a major opportunity for energy savings in the United States. Reviewers noted the proposed energy factor (EF) targets for this efficient ventless closed-loop clothes dryer using advanced infrared (IR) heating and an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) are higher than current resistance dryers, but lower than some of the better performing heat pump dryers currently available on the market.</p> 
<p>Reviewers disagreed on the strength of the project approach, specifically on if market barriers were clearly approached – with some arguing key barriers were addressed and others disagreeing. One reviewer specified that while market barriers are addressed by virtue of the proposed EF increase, the improvement is such that market cost increase must be small compared to the better-performing heat pump dryers and there were a number of commercialization barriers that might make it difficult to beat the cost point of those existing appliances – especially given the goal of a 5-year payback period. Another reviewer said the whole approach is simply too complex and that the system has “little chance in even approaching [the] milestone target.”</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project accomplishments to date did not look promising. Reviewers noted that while water extraction using the proposed technology has been demonstrated, the delivered efficiency of that method is below the milestone target of 40% extraction efficiency at only 7.3%. Reviewers also noted the ESP/exchanger efficiency had only reached efficiencies of 13%. Reviewers pointed to potential mechanical issues that could further reduce the efficiency once in place in residential systems given the dust and lint typically found in most clothes dryers, including the potential for clogging in the submicron spray head, the possibility of arcing in the precipitator, and build-up in the precipitator water collection area leading to reduced system performance (and maintenance).</p> 
<p>This project does not have any partners outside GE, leading to low collaboration scores. While some pointed to the benefit of working entirely in-house, specifically the ease in this technology entering their product line, others worried that corporate decision makers could stop work on this effort at any point. Others believed collaboration with a national lab on this pre-commercialization work could have been beneficial.</p> 
<p>Reviewers pointed to several technical challenges that need to be overcome in future work, including the optimization of nebulizer parameters, solving the arcing issues, and improving the efficiency of water extraction. However, many doubted the solutions presented by the project team would be able to resolve these issues completely. Additionally, other reviewers were unclear if this technology solution was the most promising avenue for clothes dryer energy efficiency improvement, pointing to other emerging technologies such as ultrasonic and thermoelectric that might be a better fit for the operating conditions of clothes dryers.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance and alignment of this project with BTO’s goals, and with BTO’s Windows and Building Envelope Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap. If successful, reviewers felt that this project could overcome the cost and supply chain issues associated with traditional vacuum insulated glazing (VIG) manufacturing, which could engender significant energy savings if it spurred on the widespread adoption of VIGs.</p>
<p>Despite this promise, reviewers agreed that the project’s approach had failed to make sufficient progress or to achieve its objectives. Reviewers noted that the project team had clearly and meaningfully articulated their approach to reducing manufacturing costs while improving product quality, and reviewers also highlighted that the project was correctly focused on addressing the cost issue related to developing VIGs, which was preventing smaller manufacturers from entering the market.</p> 
<p>However, reviewers were quick to note that while the project’s simulation models and experimental tests worked well, and that certain elements of the project’s deliverables had been tested and small prototypes fabricated, the main goal of the project was not achieved: the manufacturing process developed by the project team resulted in very high capital and fabrication costs, which did not meet the cost goals of the R&D roadmap and exceeded both the window manufacturer’s expectations and the market acceptance threshold. In short, reviewers found that the project had shown that the fabricate-on-demand VIG would not result in a cost-effective product.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project demonstrated good collaboration among national laboratories, technology partners, and manufacturing equipment providers, but they also noted that this collaboration did not successfully achieve the main goal of the project.</p> 
<p>Looking forward, reviewers agreed that the project team’s proposed future work was vague. Reviewers noted that the project team recommended a redirection to pursue an alternate high-performance window insulated glazed unit design that could meet both the performance and cost goals. However, while one reviewer noted that such a redirection seemed worthwhile, another was discomfited by the fact that no clear objectives or tasks were described around this effort.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>As noted in the presentation by PPG and the comments from reviewers, the research effort achieved several of the interim technical targets outlined in the scope of work for the project, but failed to meet the cost targets. Further, the performer did not believe that there were opportunities to modify the product or fabrication process enough to bring costs to a level that would be acceptable for window fabricators. The reviewers noted that the plans presented by PPG for moving forward with the project were vague. This lack of specificity is likely a result of the ongoing effort by BTO and PPG to clarify an acceptable future direction for the project that can achieve the long-term technical and cost targets required if the product is to be commercialized.</p>"

<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of the project to BTO’s goals, both the program’s performance and market goals, by using thermoelectric module technology to transfer heat for heat pump water heaters (HPWHs). The reviewers praised the core technology as well-developed and both innovative and potentially transformative in creating an affordable, reliable, and high-performance product.</p> 
<p>Reviewers concurred that this project appropriately identified critical market barriers, and one reviewer felt these were being addressed in an outstanding manner.</p>
<p>Some reviewers were concerned about stakeholder engagement, encouraging further manufacturing collaboration. Reviewers suggested the project team partner with companies involved in manufacturing HPWHs to learn more about the history of the technology and pitfalls to avoid as the project segues to a market deployment phase.</p> 
<p>One reviewer cautioned that manufacturers are reluctant to change tank design. This could become an issue during market adoption because (as was noted during the question and answer(Q&A) session), tankless water heaters are popular but the current design of this HPWH is not.</p> 
<p>While offering high praise for the technological concept underlying the project, including the coefficient of performance (COP) of this design, a few reviewers expressed concern about the path the project team would follow to achieve the stated goal of being a leader in high-volume manufacturing of this technology in the U.S. market.</p> 
<p>Several reviewers acknowledged the project team’s consultation with Whirlpool, although one reviewer suggested the principal investigator (PI) become acquainted with current and past HPWH promotions by electric utility companies. This reviewer expressed concern about what the actual retail customer price premium would be versus the $100 to $150 retail price that the PI suggested during the Q&A session. The reviewer recommended the project team undertake a review of retail cost and do a comparison with an add-on unit for efficiency and payback in order to show a payback comparison.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers described the project as timely, relevant, and clearly aligned with BTO’s goals, with an innovative approach that has potential for future advances. Reviewers generally believed this technology had the potential to replace current state-of-the-art using a novel approach with a comprehensive methodology. Reviewers noted the project team had identified critical barriers, both in terms of fundamental research barriers standing in the way of technology development (by focusing on module/system development) and also market barriers (such as cost and operating efficiency). Reviewers praised the in-house partnership with Carrier Corporation in providing metrics and market requirements to help mitigate risks and market barriers as it progresses.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted this early-stage research had successfully met its first milestones by developing and demonstrating micro-electro-calorimeter necessary to measure temperature change for electro-caloric materials. However, one reviewer noted it was unclear what other progress has been made to date, and suggested the team provide additional content or background when presenting results, especially to those not familiar with the project. Reviewers also called for additional information on the modeling approaches used to calculate the operating conditions the technology will demonstrate a coefficient of performance (COP) of 6.0.</p>
<p>Moving forward, most reviewers believed the work plan to be reasonable in addressing challenges such as scalability, demonstrating a COP of 6.0, and a complete heat pump module. Reviewers warned the project will face significant technological challenges to minimize system losses (e.g., energy, pressure, and electrical) and to resolve scale-up and long-term performance issues. One specifically pointed out the later-term issue to explore – namely the issue of long-term performance of the electro-caloric material, with fatigue and long-term degradation potentially resulting in compromised system performance. Another reviewer recommended system model validations to support the COP performance targets in the environmental application. One reviewer commented that the issue of proprietary information makes it difficult to accurately assess the project since so much cannot be divulged. Another recommended that the project team should provide more consideration on the influence of the external electric fields on the stable and safe performance of the system.</p>

<p>Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers rated this project highly relevant towards BTO’s goals, citing the need for high-performance cold-climate heat pumps and the project performer’s close relationship to an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) capable of building market share in the area. Because of this close collaboration with Carrier, reviewers were positive about the potential for commercialization – though a few were unclear if this partnership was sufficient for DOE’s teamwork and collaboration purposes. Reviewers were also generally approving of the project team’s approach, specifically praising the iterative design steps, attention to overcoming market barriers, and utilizing a realistic approach to the issue of needing to raise the supply air temperature in cold weather. However, one reviewer was unclear what the project’s baseline target was competing against (gas or electric heat) while another said that while the project appears to be addressing certain market barriers, the proprietary nature of so much of the project made it all a “black box” in terms of evaluating performance testing.</p> 
<p>Reviewers praised the project in meeting or exceeding BTO’s coefficient of performance (COP) and capacity targets. These accomplishments were marked among project strengths that give it “an excellent path to production and marketing.” However, one reviewer said the lack of description of the technology made it difficult to determine the likelihood of success or degree of accomplishment. Reviewers recommended that field test results be presented at a future meeting and suggested an electric utility company comment on system performance under extremely cold conditions (-10?F) to determine whether this contributes to winter peak loading due to resistance heating coming on at that temperature, which in turn could affect customer demand charges.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted that proposed future work would be focused on production, marketing, and distribution. One reviewer noted that during the presentation, the principal investigator (PI) suggested that a very different design is now being pursued than was developed earlier in the project. Another took issue with the proposed cost-cutting to reduce the payback period to less than one year, arguing a two-to-three-year payback for commercial applications was sufficient. Cost-cutting to meet the return on investment (ROI) criterion was marked as a project weakness because it could degrade efficiency and durability. Still another said that more attention should be paid to defrosting at low ambient temperatures.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this HVAC project focused on refrigerants was relevant to BTO’s goals due to its primary energy improvement goal of 30%, but one reviewer noted that given the sparse information shared on the technology it was hard to be sure. Reviewers noted the project team’s approach to maximizing compressor efficiency and reliable operation under a wide range of conditions was reasonable, though again they noted the lack of specific technical information presented that might help better information project evaluation. One reviewer noted, however, that while specific global warming potential (GWP) was not disclosed, the presenter indicated the new refrigerant had a GWP reduction of 75% compared to R-410A.</p> 
<p>This project is in its first phase and approaching an August 2016 Go/No-go review, as such many reviewers noted that there was not much to evaluate at this stage. However, it appeared to many reviewers that the project seemed to be on track and that a proof-of-concept test was scheduled for July 2016. UTRC is partnering with in-house manufacturer Carrier on this work, which reviewers thought was well planned and enabled the project team to commercialize the resulting product and that the Go/No-Go meeting would help reduce risk and improve the value proposition for Carrier.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted that Carrier has a long history of developing successful HVAC projects, that the team is very knowledgeable, and that the GWP target reduction of 75% is good. While one reviewer noted the lack of firm information to rate the project’s accomplishments to date, another thought the presenter illustrated that the new refrigerant system design indicated energy efficiency gains and that additional savings could be gained from incorporating variable speed functionality.</p> 
<p>The project team aims to move the technology from a technology readiness level (TRL) of 2 to TRL 5 and achieve 30% primary energy savings over the project term. Reviewers recommended that DOE staff should be provided complete access to research work – even if that means signing a confidentiality agreement – in order to project the agency’s investments in such proprietary projects. Another reviewer suggested that BTO verify the 75% GWP reduction in the refrigerant being used.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that improving the efficiency of motors in the ¼ to 1-horsepower range are relevant to BTO’s program goals, especially since motors are a significant user of energy. One reviewer specifically noted that the project’s approach to improving the electronics of an electronically controlled motor (ECM) by reducing energy draw once the motor reaches synchronous speed aligned with BTO’s energy efficiency goals. While one reviewer noted that the project team indicated primary energy savings from the motor in commercial and residential systems, another reviewer noted the project did not explicitly explain their efficiency goals so it could not be determined if the project meets BTO’s targets. Reviewers recommended that in future presentations, the project team should show more details including project elements, specific objectives, previous milestones and deliverables, and metrics for measuring the value of efficiency improvements of the technology.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally questioned the project’s approach and accomplishments due to a perceived lack of information on the project’s ability to address market barriers, performance data to date, and specific goals and target information. Specifically, reviewers noted that without a prototype, there was no data from which to judge design or performance to date. Another reviewer noted that HVAC industry motors already have quite high efficiencies so this efficiency issue does not represent a bottleneck. One wondered why in an era of variable frequency drives (VFDs) would money and time be spent on a project to develop an ECM with five speed/torque-controlled speed settings. Another commented that various standard design issues such as motor requirements for torque, reliability, and UL approval were not addressed.</p> 
<p>Reviewers also expressed some uncertainty over what is the ultimate purpose of this effort with one reviewer remarking that it is “confusing to understand what is to be accomplished – is it a novel design concept or a control problem which entails variation of motor speed?” Reviewers recommended the project team should clearly identify which aspect this project is intended to resolve. One reviewer also made the observation that the project will address part-load issues through variation of speed and that efficiency drops during part-load are “serious challenges,” but that “the project is not presented as such.”</p> 
<p>Reviewers favorably rated this project’s collaboration approach, with one reviewer saying Carrier and UTRC are “solid and key industry partners to help develop and deploy this technology,” though another felt UTRC’s input was unclear from the presentation. One reviewer recommended that BTO should clarify if the technology developed under this project will be limited to Carrier products only.</p> 
<p>Reviewers positively rated the project’s future work plans to complete prototype fabrication, conduct testing, and demonstrate the technology in the field. Reviewers pointed to QM Power’s past BTO demonstration projects, which they thought could be a positive indicator for this project. One reviewer recommended the team document any cost premiums from this motor.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewers Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers differed in their ratings of the relevance of the project. One reviewer was very enthusiastic about it, rating as outstanding the relevance to BTO’s goals of energy efficiency improvements, praising the 12% efficiency improvement with 3-year payback goals as a significant advancement in appliance performance, and with good progress and appropriate future work for a promising and “solid technology. However, another reviewer was deeply skeptical of this project’s goals, on the basis that such a 12% improvement can only come with a significantly more complex system, and remarking that in a typical refrigerator, the evaporator and fan are typically the simplest components. This reviewer also took issue with the project plans to replace a relatively simple heat exchanger and fan with a much more complex sealed rotating heat exchanger with air bearings that is expected to be maintenance-free for 20 years. The reviewer concluded that the complexity and risk in such a system may not be amenable to refrigerator manufacturers.</p> 
<p>Reviewers disagreed on accomplishments to date, with one reviewer commenting that the complications of this system for defrosting and system reliability likely will not be addressed with a single working prototype and that it was unlikely any manufacturer would want to move forward with commercialization. But another reviewer viewed the technical achievements favorably and concluded that the team identified several lessons learned even as it moves forward in a good direction.</p> 
<p>Regarding collaboration, two reviewers found the partnership between two DOE national laboratories (Oak Ridge and Sandia) and the University of Maryland to be robust and appropriate to date, while a third claimed that the project needs a refrigerator manufacturer to emphasize simplicity and system reliability.</p>
<p>In assessing the project, one reviewer identified no major weaknesses but only minor technical issues that need to be addressed, such as ensuring baseplate design allows for good heat transfer and refrigeration distribution. Other reviewers expressed some concerns, with one commenting that the project seems to be a continuation of previous work with planned activities failing to show strength. This reviewer recommended the project team explain succinctly the new concept and why it is worth funding. A third reviewer claimed that the whole concept replaces a simple system with an overly complicated one for only modest efficiency gains, and in which no refrigerator manufacturer seems to have any interest. This reviewer urged the project team to try to find one before completing the prototype.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, stating that the solid-state lighting program, and this project in particular, are in line with the BTO roadmap, efficiency targets and market needs. Additionally, a reviewer commented on a critical point: this project correctly identified a market need, increasing white organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).</p>
<p>Reviewers cited the project’s technical goals as a strength, namely, the idea of using a porous substrate to make a low-cost enhanced light out-coupling substrate characterized by controllable voids in a polymer system. However, one reviewer remarked that market barriers such as manufacturability and cost impact were not mentioned, though the reviewer recognized they may be out of the scope of this project.</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt the project successfully demonstrated a 1.6X enhancement using porous substrate and 1.9X enhancement with silver nanowire-embedded polyimide and porous polyimide combination. However, one reviewer pointed out that there is still a large gap between the 1.9X light extraction achieved and the 3X goal that must be achieved in the next few months. The reviewer also noted that the measured results of 32 lumens per watt (lm/W) is far from the 130 lm/W goal and questioned whether the 3X light extraction is consistent with that goal and if there is an issue with the material being used.</p> 
<p>Reviewers each remarked on the lack of and need for industry collaborators, as well as clarification of roles of each participant to determine subsequent collaboration and integration into the project. These industry partners would be especially beneficial when transitioning from lab to prototype and production, as they might help identify processes that are scalable and those that are not.</p> 
<p>One reviewer expressed concern on the path forward to large-scale manufacturing once the project is complete and recommended that there be large-scale demonstration of high-throughput production of the porous PI. This reviewer also suggested a possible technical recommendation for the project team on substrate-trapped light through use of certain scatterers.</p> 
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>Princeton University will continue this project on applying a porous substrate with controllable voids in a polymer system to enhance light extraction in OLEDs – a key barrier for OLED technology. Tests with silver nanowires embedded in the substrate have reached a 1.9X light extraction enhancement. Further work will be performed to raise the light extraction toward the 3X level, as the project will conclude at the end of 2016. DOE’s Acquisition and Project Management (APM) guidance will be used to wrap up.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed the project was well aligned with BTO’s goals and that the development of an electrochemical compressor (ECC)-based system for air-conditioning applications is highly relevant for BTO’s mission both by the advancement of innovative technologies and potential energy savings. Reviewers described the project team having strong teamwork and collaboration, with one noting the team is working an array of global market leaders. Reviewers positively commented on the partnership ranging from fundamental research (University of Delaware), testing and validation (Oak Ridge National Laboratory), and commercial (Haier), though one said the role of Haier was not clearly presented.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team has a good grasp of the challenges facing ECC and that close cooperation with market leaders enabled the project team to identify critical barriers. Another reviewer remarked that the barriers and risks in the form of sensitivity to non-condensable gases and sensitivity to condenser and evaporator pressure were not explicitly addressed. The project’s prototype design, construction, and testing generally were rated as satisfactory by reviewers, with one noting that achieving a coefficient of performance (COP) greater than 4 is a noteworthy challenge and it would be a “significant advance” if the team can do this.</p> 
<p>One reviewer suggested it would be beneficial to provide interim evaluation steps of the experimental results during testing and provide an approached statement of work (SOW). Reviewers recommended increased testing and modeling to generate confidence with the project’s performance and reliability targets across operating conditions, addressing technical risks (such as durability and operating envelope range for a fixed systems), and the long-term performance impacts from the presence of non-condensable gas (and how to mitigate it with proper sealing with consumer grade equipment). Another reviewer recommended exploring the issues of the narrow voltage range for peak COP, which could result in a substantial drop in membrane performance from variations in the power supply.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Most reviewers agreed this was relevant for BTO’s goals, with several commenting on its potential to reduce energy consumption and achieve market penetration for residential-scale gas-fired absorption heat pumps given the presented two-to-five year payback period and technical specifications, design simplicity, and volume manufacturing requirements. However, one reviewer noted that comparisons to standard heat pump technology overstate the savings by not considering the improved efficiencies of the latter; while lower sales prices on gas-fired heat pumps have dropped, the requirement for more indoor components renders cost-effectiveness uncertain.</p> 
<p>Reviewers were generally positive on the project’s adherence to four basic elements, the design approach focused on cost-and reliability optimization, and the participation of major gas industry players such as A.O. Smith and Gas Technology Institute. However, one reviewer was concerned that the project’s lack of cooling results in additional cost to the consumer, resulting in an expensive full home conditioning system potentially significantly above the $4,500 target price. Reviewers commented that while prototypes have been developed and tested, there were doubts that the efficiency targets and cost objectives could be met in the market. One reviewer commented that with unit performance looking promising, the unit sales would need to become very substantial before the cost objective could be met.</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally viewed the project as having high value deliverables to the target audience, success in reaching performance goals, success in creating a marketable product, and good alignment with BTO program goals. However, one reviewer recommended that there be no further funding of this or similar projects due to cost and a lack of savings over electric alternatives; with the increased penetration of renewables, they argued, the technology’s greenhouse gas source reductions vanish.</p> 
<p>Most reviewers were pleased with the project’s beta testing plans and were hopeful the company could help the product find its way into the market without future DOE funding. One reviewer recommended that while the project has collaborated with existing players in the gas heat market, future collaboration with new players such as builders in cold climates and air handler/water heater manufacturers might help develop a more realistic approach to market entry. Reviewers also recommended the project team consider emphasizing issues of serviceability to improve market entry and fully addressing defrosting control. Specifically, they recommended giving special attention to defrosting at low outdoor temperatures and observing worst-case defrost cycles.</p>

<p>Relevance: 3.17    Approach: 2.83   Accomplishments: 2.34  Project Collaboration: 2.59  Future Work: 2.83</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project’s intention to develop transparent insulation for fenestration was a critical area for building energy and BTO, and therefore the project was well aligned with BTO's mission and its Windows and Building Envelope Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap. One reviewer commented, however, that while the project had a nice goal, its scientific approach was not solidly established in physics.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team was approaching the project’s core objective appropriately, but they also highlighted several technical challenges that remained to be addressed. Reviewers noted that the project had identified challenges relating to cost, durability, and visible transmittance, and was correctly focused on investigating different processing methods to overcome these technical challenges and achieve the required visible transmittance at lower cost. However, one reviewer felt that the key challenge of combining transparent features with high insulating abilities was not yet being addressed, and was also concerned that a key criterion (transmissivity) was not being paid sufficient attention.</p> 
<p>In terms of progress, one reviewer noted that sufficient visible transmittance had been achieved at a low cost, but also flagged other issues that need to be solved to achieve near-term goals. This reviewer further asserted that there was a long way to go toward the project’s medium- and long-term goals. Another reviewer commented that it was too early to demonstrate the market impact of this project, given that product development was still at an initial stage and that there were still challenges to overcome. Similarly, a third noted that while the project team had presented some scientific evidence of one possibility for developing the targeted glazing, this possibility represented a high risk due to unclear technical solutions.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed on the project team’s level of collaboration with external partners. One reviewer described the project as having strong collaborations, with one formal partner already on board and discussions underway with others that could help bring the technology to market. In contrast, a second reviewer described the project’s communications with the key stakeholders as “limited,” while a third commented that the project team did not demonstrate any strong connections with stakeholders. Another reviewer felt that no substantial collaboration was mentioned, but conjectured that perhaps this was due to the early stage of the research.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed about the project’s future plans. Some reviewers described the project’s proposed future work as reasonable, noting that the team had identified challenges and had proposed research plans to overcome these barriers. Further, these reviewers concurred with the project’s pursuit of industrial manufacturing, and felt that its industry partner’s interest in funding this work was promising. Another reviewer, however, described the planned next steps as highly exploratory, and was concerned that it might end up having little success, given that the project was ending soon. This same reviewer also felt that a thorough feasibility study would have been nice for all proposed solutions.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>The work conducted in this project has been principally focused on an exploration of the potential for the proposed chemistry. The scope and budget were sufficiently limited that the principal investigator (PI) necessarily had to limit his pursuit of technical challenges or opportunities to only those that he felt would be most fruitful. As a result, medium- and long-term goals were sometimes beyond the reach of the project. Guidance from BTO focused on ensuring that the nanoparticles had the potential to provide appropriate properties for the desired application. While windows and skylights were the target application area, BTO also suggested that if visible transmittance (VT) and haze goals were not attainable, high R-value particles could be valuable in opaque insulation applications.</p>
<p>Given the limited scope of the project, there was an appropriate level of engagement with the industrial partner. In particular, in the latter part of the project the partner was able to provide good feedback to the PI regarding the needs of the industry with respect to R-value, cost, and haze and VT. The test window constructed with the industry partner provided valuable insights to the PI and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) with respect to how the nanoparticles need to be prepared if they are to be suitable for the insulating glass unit (IGU) fabrication process. It appears that the presentation did not make sufficiently clear the benefits to both the project and the partner through their engagement in the research.</p>
<p>The PI for this project recently received a DOE Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy  (ARPA-E) Single-Pane Highly Insulating Efficient Lucid Design (SHIELD) award for similar highly-insulating low-haze porous silica nanoparticles. While a research project moving from BTO to ARPA-E is perhaps the “wrong direction” from a technology development or technology readiness level (TRL) perspective, the work conducted under the BTO award helped demonstrate the potential viability of the technology and approach with sufficient depth to secure follow-on funding that will address many of the concerns raised by reviewers.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that an efficient compressor capable of handling low-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants is a key concern of BTO’s, though one reviewer cautioned that previous work using centrifugal compressors for ultra-small scale has faced serious challenges that the presentation did not address. One reviewer noted that the experience of the project team and their resources should enable them to “give it a good shot.”</p> 
<p>The project team noted the key issues were efficiency, system integration, and cost with compressor efficiency greater than 78% needed. Reviewers were unable to evaluate the exact refrigerant GWP value or name, although the presenter noted in the question and answer (Q&A) session that they would be able to do so once the producer gave them the permission. The presenter specified the refrigerant was non-flammable with approximately 50% improved GWP, as that characteristic was a requirement of project partner Lennox. Overall, reviewers agreed that the project had a competent team with thorough knowledge required to develop this new technology – though one reviewer questioned how much work was shared between groups. Most, however, felt the team was equipped to handle the design challenges posed by the technology. Several reviewers questioned the 50% improved GWP figure, with some recommending DOE verify the findings and others wondering why the goal was set so low (instead of a higher figure such as 80% improved).</p>
<p>Reviewers were divided when evaluating project accomplishments to date, with some noting the project is on track with stated goals, others arguing some tasks are behind schedule, one saying it was too early in the process for meaningful results, and another fearing the task was not well defined and the lack of data reduced confidence that this project was a good investment.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that future work looked promising and could lead to a mature product, but several reviewers expressed concern over the lack of presented milestones and Go/No-Go decision points and worried the scope might exceed the schedule presented. One reviewer recommended the project team better explain why and how this technology will be superior to existing compressors with another noting that Lennox was involved in a similar project in the 1980s, pointing out the problems that team encountered with motor drive and gear box designs as a warning to the project team.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed this project is highly relevant and well aligned with BTO’s energy efficiency improvement goals, with one adding the technology looked to be the most promising competitor to conventional vapor compression systems in the near term. Reviewers noted the solid approach to packaging roof-top air conditioning technologies and increasing the technology readiness level, but some were confused if the project was truly a non-vapor compression project given the inclusion of electrochemical compression and mechanical vapor compression components.</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that a major strength of the work is the game-changing use of membrane technology in AC applications in various climates, though some expressed concern over technical and performance issues with membrane-based systems, including fouling, reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness. One reviewer said the system had too many energy-consuming components and another was concerned that any air leaks introduced into the system could seriously degrade performance.</p> 
<p>The project presented at the Peer Review less than six months into the performance period, which led many reviewers to remark there had been few accomplishments to date aside from partner identification, high-level system design, and membrane dehumidification modeling. One reviewer warned that the high uncertainty in vapor compressor component may be the critical item preventing the project from achieving its stated objectives. Several reviewers were concerned cost might be a serious barrier to entry, with one reviewer noting that relatively little cost analysis data had been presented. Reviewers agreed the project team had a good mix of industrial and academic partners, subcontractors, and collaborators, though one recommended the inclusion of a large manufacturing partner of air-conditioning systems.</p> 
<p>Reviewers emphasized that this project is very early stage technology research and development (R&D) and generally agreed that developing prototypes, undergoing laboratory demonstrations and testing, and evaluating markets were logical future plans. One reviewer proposed market evaluation and target selection be conducted prior to engineering, design, and fabrication and another one urged the project team to identify scaled-up prototype performance targets soon, and then focus on testing and providing experimental results to provide confidence in the performance and reliability levels. Another recommended the team demonstrate how particle contamination effects the long-term performance of the membrane.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers characterized the development of miniaturized heat exchangers (HXs) as critical to BTO’s program goals and fundamental in supporting performance improvements across a wide range of energy-consuming devices such as heat pumps, air conditioners, refrigerators, and water heaters. As a fundamental research project, reviewers noted it was difficult to rate them on market barriers as the focus was on optimizing design to enable new manufacturing and overcoming fundamental knowledge barriers.</p> 
<p>Reviewers were impressed by the project’s progress to date, including the fact the project team had analyzed over 15 HX geometries, developed multi-scale modeling and optimization methodologies, developed a system-test facility, and fabricated both 1-kilowatt (kW) and 10-kW prototypes. One reviewer was concerned that the configurations were mechanically sound or could sufficiently address air or hydronic contamination issues, though reviewers were otherwise generally optimistic about the tube’s shapes and flow patterns findings might be applied to practical products. One reviewer was confused if additive manufacturing had been abandoned in place of assembling individual tubes. Some reviewers noted it was unclear if there has been sufficient dialogue across the project team to actually enable viable products and applications. Despite these misgivings, reviewers generally praised the project’s teamwork and collaboration, especially with industry partners, whom reviewers felt had a solid understanding of the problem and how to best approach it within the budget. Reviewers also praised the project team’s publications in open literature.</p> 
<p>Reviewers recommended that the project consider the volume of physical materials used for this type of HX, citing the sensitivity of manufacturers to the price of copper. Another recommended DOE and stakeholders develop minimum mechanical and fluid constraints for the test modules. Other reviewers recommended that the project team should consider durability issues more, focusing on physical environmental and contamination potential of miniaturized HXs and ensuring miniaturized designs would be able to tolerate the abuse that conventional HXs undergo and would not be more susceptible to environmental contaminants.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers differed in their assessments of the project’s relevance to BTO goals. Although some reviewers felt that the project aligned well with BTO’s goals, others expressed concern with the project’s chances of success, with one reviewer citing specifically the competition the product would receive from developed or more mature heat pump technologies. In response to the principal investigator’s (PI’s) reply during the question and answer (Q&A) session that the heating-to-cooling output (ratio) can be “adjusted a little,” one reviewer remarked that the flexibility between heating and cooling appears limited – meaning there will have to be potentially extensive periods of the sinking of heating and cooling to obtain the needed ratio.</p> 
<p>Because the system is so significantly different from traditional heat pump technologies, reviewers expressed concern with how such a new technology would be marketed to and introduced into the residential market (including both installers and end users). “It is not likely to be an easy sell,” remarked one reviewer. Another reviewer commented that this is a highly complex type of heat pump and it remains to be seen whether it can be manufactured at an acceptable cost, but felt the project team was moving in the right direction. An additional reviewer felt that the number of utilities or other organizations who expressed interest in this project was impressive.</p>
<p>Reviewers remarked favorably on the technical accomplishments and progress of the project including building and testing a second-generation prototype, making necessary redesigns of components, and developing baseline simulations for tuning and validation. However, reviewers expressed concern that it wasn’t clear how this project would translate to meeting market goals, with one reviewer commenting that the anticipated first and second year unit sales goal was too ambitious. This reviewer warned that unexpected issues, troubleshooting, and replacing failed units over a wide geographic area could be very costly to the company.</p>
<p>While some reviewers praised the participation of so many stakeholders, they pointed out those who would manufacture, install, and maintain the units were so far missing. One reviewer questioned the nature of the contributions of the many advisors to the project, specifically requesting additional information on the guidance and advice they were providing. Another reviewer, however, saw all this participation as evidence of the significant interest by many stakeholders as an indication of the project’s value.</p> 
<p>While reviewers praised the strong technical capabilities and dedication to success of the project team, as well as its success to date, they warned that this is a complicated and expensive new technology. They cautioned that there is a long way to go in many areas of design, analysis, integration and modulating, reducing cost while improving durability, and carrying out demonstrations and pilot testing. One reviewer expressed concern over marketing such a novel technology in the residential heat pump, while another recommended a more cautious approach to market introduction, whereby the first 100 units in the field are carefully monitored, especially as controls and sensors have been problematic features for many HVAC and water heating products.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers viewed this project as relevant and aligned with BTO goals. Reviewers were intrigued by the potential of the S-RAM compressor technology that uses air (ASHRAE number R-729) as a refrigerant and is capable of achieving 50% energy savings with a payback period under four years. They viewed this as a unique project with an excellent team involved in very innovative work, with an air refrigerant system that looks very promising for improving efficiency and reducing energy usage.</p> 
<p>However, noting that the project is still in an early stage and running behind schedule (valve development has been underway for 8 years), reviewers expressed concern that the technology (including the regenerator) has not yet been successfully tested with efficiency predictions yet to be verified. Instead, they noted the focus still on overcoming the market barrier of developing a suitable compressor, the test stand for which is still being built at Purdue University.</p> 
<p>Reviewers remarked that even with this market barrier being addressed, it is still very hard to see the path toward commercial application of this technology and wondered if it would be configured with carbon dioxide (CO2) or air cycles in real-world applications. Another reviewer said that the approach had not been described in enough detail during the presentation to assess, but that overall the project team seems to have things under control.</p> 
<p>Reviewers also expressed concern that the project was heavy on institutions helping develop the technology and short on industry partners that will be needed to move ahead with commercialization. One reviewer said that the technology is still not ready to be shared with manufacturers. Another wondered how “manufacturable” is the compressor/expander system since that would influence its cost-effectiveness.</p> 
<p>Looking ahead, reviewers said compressor and cycle testing is the critical next step and will help determine the best applications for this system. Reviewers expressed hope that the focus would be on component testing and heat pump system testing to ensure reliability and manufacturability. One reviewer said that DOE should consider this a high-risk technology that does not presently have a widespread effective application and that the listed applications should undergo vetting to settle on initial ones. The reviewer suggested an application in heat recovery chillers.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers strongly agreed this project was highly relevant to BTO’s goals of reducing energy consumption from clothes dryers as stated in BTO’s 2016 - 2020 Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP). Reviewers pointed to the performance targets of this new technology matching the goals set out in the MYPP with a target of an energy factor (EF) of at least 6 and energy savings of 40%, which represents significant savings over conventional electric resistance dryers. Multiple reviewers commented that the project appeared promising in offering improved efficiency at a reasonable cost point that could encourage pickup in the market.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed the project approach was “solid,” in the words of one reviewer, with the project team recognizing technical and market barriers and utilizing an approach to mitigate those factors. One reviewer specifically praised the project team’s effort to encompass thermoelectric technology into the current dryer footprint in a way that is not a “radical departure” from current technology. Reviewers favorably rated the project on its prototype and associated experimental data, as well as the project team’s modeling work.</p> 
<p>Reviewers pointed to improvements, independent of this project, in thermoelectric technology gained from moving to a polymer substrate (away from a ceramic substrate) that would help this project achieve its desired goals. One reviewer did caution that the incremental first cost impact from the thermoelectric technology remains to be seen, which could have a major impact on meeting its cost goals.</p>
<p>Reviewers praised the partnership between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Sheetak, though one reviewer worried that with Sheetak participating in multiple DOE projects and being a small business, their resources may be stretched such that attention to each project may be limited. Other reviewer comments focused on the need to involve appliance manufacturers in this work.</p> 
<p>Reviewers remarked that controls, performance, and design improvement work plans were in place for future work, with one reviewer saying “the next phase of work is warranted.” However, without a manufacturer on board, reviewers worried that future commercialization opportunities for this technology are limited.</p>

<p>Relevance: 3.50    Approach: 3.34   Accomplishments: 3.25  Project Collaboration: 3.17  Future Work: 3.00</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project was highly relevant to BTO’s program goals, based on its aspirations to both improve window performance and reduce manufacturing costs. If successful, one reviewer believed this project could have a large impact on the market for high performance windows.</p>
<p>Reviewers also generally agreed on the project’s approach, with one reviewer commenting that the approach comprehensively addressed technical and market challenges, including developing test specifications and protocols and carrying out a series of performance tests at levels. Reviewers did identify certain issues, however including the following:</p> 
<p>1) the project focused exclusively on the thermal bridge issue while underestimating other barriers to R7 windows (e.g. glazing, spacer); 
2) certain assumptions in its simulation models could lead to inaccurate predictions for the heat flow and temperature patterns in the system; 
3) the proposed approach to foam materials introduced the foam properties without defining the direction;  and;
4) no initial cost prediction was provided.</p> 
<p>One reviewer also recommended that the project team add an overall description, analysis, and justification of its envisioned R7 commercial window, specifically identifying how its novel thermal bridge technology played a critical role in the final product. Reviewers felt that the project was making good progress, that it was on track to achieving its original research objectives, and that its potential market impact was evident. Despite this overall assessment, however, reviewers did note that several critical properties had not yet been tested, and that the simulation model had not yet been validated, so there was work left to do.</p>
<p>Reviewers observed good collaboration between the project team and its partners, notably Kawneer and certain key material partners, and also that the project team had built strong communications with key stakeholders to accelerate movement of its proposed technology. One reviewer also noted that further partnerships with a manufacturing line integrator were being initiated, which the reviewer felt was a reasonable step.</p>
<p>Reviewers described the project’s future plans as comprehensive, meaningful, and built on past progress with a focus on market development and assessment, which would help advance commercialization and deployment of the product. Moving forward, one reviewer encouraged the project team to consider the thermal cycling effect and the interface between the foam and window frame, while another observed that additional and thorough testing may be needed around structural and thermal condition at different window sizes.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>The assessment of the reviewers is consistent with the perspective of the program that, on the whole, the project is progressing well and has addressed many of the major technical risks with respect to the frame design under investigation. It is anticipated that many of the concerns raised by reviewers with respect to foam properties, cost, and overall performance, are being addressed by the performer and other project partners. Validation of the simulation models is an issue that can be investigated further by the principal investigator (PI), as is thermal cycling, though the latter is likely outside the schedule and budget of the current award.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>This project received generally good marks across the various categories evaluated by the reviewers. With its goal of developing thermally conductive siloxane encapsulant materials that could replace standard silicone in light-emitting diode (LED) packages, reviewers generally saw this project as relevant to BTO’s goals, with one reviewer noting that if the 20 to 30% of energy absorbed by phosphors lost to heat could be reduced, it would provide for cooler and longer life LED systems, which in turn would help with the marketing of mid-power phosphor-converted LEDs.</p>
<p>Reviewers were a bit uncertain of the accomplishments to date for this project, noting that they have been limited thus far and that the 1 watt per meter kelvin (W/m-K) thermal conductivity goal is an aggressive one in which the best results to date are only about 0.6 W/m-K and it is unclear if that gap can be closed – and whether that result is itself sufficient enough to provide the desired benefits. Echoing that sentiment, another reviewer noted that the first five tasks had been achieved, resulting in the synthesis of hybrid siloxanes with improved dispersion and reduced scattering but a thermal conductivity still below the 1 W/m-K goal.</p> 
<p>Reviewers responded positively to the project’s integration and collaboration, noting the project team had worked closely and effectively with Osram Sylvania Inc., and that partners were providing proper input and perspective. One reviewer suggested that it would be helpful to clarify the roles of the various parties including financial ones (i.e., who receives and who contributes funding?) and to know Osram’s view on project progress and the likelihood of whether the approach is likely to be adapted for manufacturing and production. 
Looking ahead, one reviewer said it was not clear what needed to be done to close the performance gap between the target and what has so far been achieved. Another reviewer said that the key parameters that need to be measured are LED package performance and reliability in order to provide an initial approximation of LED package reliability – and thus negate the need for significant testing by the LED manufacturer. Reviewers expressed some concern on technical issues involving the effect of scattering on transmissibility, the ability to produce particles of precise size, and the thermal stability of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) treated particles.</p> 
<p>Reviewer recommendations included thermal modeling at the nano-and-microscale in addition to the molecular level, and addressing the effects of the ligands, surfactants, and particle loading on the curing rate and degree of cure of silicone (since these effects represent a potential reliability and manufacturability issue). Another reviewer cited an article by one of the collaborators, noting that it puts this project in a broader context, and the reviewer asked if this project has any bearing on other conversion layer architecture.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University will continue this project on thermally conductive siloxane materials with embedded phosphors (i.e. encapsulent) to enhance the heat transfer of LED packages. Test results have produced 0.6 W/m-K heat transfer towards a goal of 1.0 W/m-K. The project will conclude at the end of 2016. DOE’s Acquisition and Project Management (APM) guidance will be used to wrap up.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the concept of the ultrasonic clothes dryer was a great idea that “could be a disruptive technology” and “can radically advance clothes dryer technology and energy savings,” which has so far been well-developed and executed. Reviewers noted that the project fit well within BTO’s goals of reducing energy use and, if successful, could result in an appliance more efficient than any currently on the market. Reviewers noted that the barriers encountered by the research team, such as amplification and synchronizing the nested piezoelectric units, were to be expected of cutting edge technologies. One reviewer noted the new technology offered an opportunity to radically reconfigure dryer design given it does not need to rely on conventional drum design.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed the team was working well with its academic and industry partners, though one reviewer questioned if the impact on the industry partners’ conventional appliance sales had been considered.</p> 
<p>Reviewers disagreed on project accomplishments and impacts to date. While some reviewers praised the research strategy and demonstration results to date, others were doubtful that the results indicated the technology could be successfully scaled up. In particular, one reviewer noted the discrepancy in results reporting, citing that the presentation reported- a drying time of a 14-square inch piece of fabric alternatively as 14 seconds or 7.5 minutes in the course of the presentation. Given the 7.5 minute drying time for such a small fabric sample, there was doubt the technology could be scaled up to handle large clothing loads. Another reviewer questioned the capability of the technology to handle complex, multi-layer fabrics – a requirement this reviewer said was key to convincing skeptics of the technology.</p>
<p>Similarly, reviewers noted that while the original project plan called for full-scale prototype testing to begin in December 2015, it appeared the project team was still working on fundamental concept development issues. It was unclear to reviewers when a full-scale working prototype would be developed. Reviewers generally thought the research team needed to demonstrate the technology’s ability to work across larger clothes loads and fabric types to give the community a better idea of its full-scale applications.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers gave the project uniformly high marks for relevance to BTO’s goals, describing the project as timely and relevant. They were also generally positive in their remarks on project approach, noting that it is still in its early stages with much yet to be developed. With such an early stage project, reviewers approved of the project team’s progress in reaching out to commercial partners, with one reviewer recommending engaging with a material supplier sooner to help overcome risk from magnet cost, form factor, and availability.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted the project had only been working for six months and that initial steps such as establishing partnerships with materials manufacturers, developing a one-dimensional (1-D) discrete model, and formulating the concept design were in support of project objectives. One reviewer said that the project team had identified as many critical barriers with these issues having been presented – such as magnet design and accuracy of machining along with the need to mitigate the effect of increased frequency on system balance. Another reviewer said that the team had designed a project to overcome the barrier of system cost, complicity, and achieving theoretical efficiency by exploring a new magnetocaloric material (MCM) architecture using solids to transfer heat.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted a few technical weaknesses, the cost-effectiveness and availability of the MCM and its design; refinement and validation of the thermodynamic model; and addressing technical risk from increasing frequency of system, managing friction between the rods; and the strength of the magnetic field and the losses associated with producing such a field that could offset potential increased coefficient of performance (COP) benefits of the device itself. Reviewers recommended the team provide additional experimental data to validate the modeling or provided suggested improvements to its fidelity.</p> 
<p>For future work, one reviewer said that there are many technical risks that could prevent this project from achieving its goals and another urged the team to move forward to advance this “potentially very useful technology.” Another reviewer noted that the lack of a negative effect on magnetic fields on human health should be “emphasized and strongly justified.” A second reviewer suggested taking into account heat exchanger effectiveness to system performance.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers strongly agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals. One reviewer commented that the development of a low-cost, R25 composite foam insulation board for high performance building envelopes was well aligned with BTO's goals to improve buildings' energy efficiency. Another reviewer echoed this sentiment, noting that the advanced insulation product that would result from this project was directly supportive of the goals of the Windows and Building Envelope Research and Development (R&D) Roadmap.</p>
<p>Reviewers similarly agreed on the appropriateness of the project’s approach. One reviewer described the approach – which at this stage was about prototype fabrication and testing – as clear and convincing, while another noted that critical barriers had been identified and were being addressed comprehensively. From a technical perspective, one reviewer noted that the project’s approach was reasonable, but another warned that the void-to-solid ratio – a key parameter of encapsulated foam – had not been considered. Finally, one reviewer flagged that while both R-value and cost were performance targets, efforts appeared focused on R-value whereas there was much less discussion of the targeted cost goal.</p>
<p>Reviewers commented that the project was progressing well, having already carried out lab-scale and thermal testing and modeling of a first-phase assembly-line product, and were pleased that lessons learned from the initial test were being integrated into the second phase. One reviewer noted that the research’s achievements can be found in the favorable performance of test products, though they cautioned that quality control might still be an issue. One reviewer suggested that more samples should be tested to produce more conclusive results, while another identified several specific flaws in the project’s approach, including that simulation models considered heat flow in only one dimension and that the project team did not validate the simulation models.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project demonstrated good collaboration between Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Firestone Building Products Company, and NanoPore, Inc., and that the project team showed a strong understanding of the key stakeholders needed to accelerate movement of the new composite insulation into the market. Reviewers concurred that proposed future work appeared appropriate to address identified issues, and that proposed next steps were necessary and suitable for reaching project goals.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted that there appeared to be a lot of work to do to make the composite insulation a cost-effective, commercially-available product with satisfactory long-term durability, but highlighted that the project was already looking at code compliance, which reviewers identified as a positive step. Reviewers’ main concerns around future work were that the project team provided no timeline for additional tasks, and that the presentation did not clearly highlight potential risks or mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p> 
<p>This research program has involved extensive collaboration between all of the major parties participating on the project, which is reflected in the quality of the work and the generally favorable responses from the reviewers. The concerns that were raised by the reviewers will, in general, be addressed during the balance of the project performance period, or were omitted from the presentation in the interest of time. In particular, work will continue to examine uniformity of foam filling with the composite boards and the effect of various modified atmosphere insulation (MAI) panel configurations on foam filling and void formation, and a techno-economic analysis to examine market conditions and production costs is ongoing and will help define the required price point for the composite boards to be cost-effective and priced appropriately for the target market(s). Reviewers raised some specific concerns regarding a lack of characterization of the polyisocyanurate (PIC) foam, but it should be noted that this project does not focus on changing the PIC chemistry or deposition method, but rather on the engineering challenges associated with fabricating PIC boards with encapsulated MAI panels.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that air conditioning is a major energy user in the U.S. and this project represents an opportunity for significant energy savings relevant to BTO’s goals. Reviewers were generally dubious to potential energy savings from this technology due to its early stage in the development cycle, while feasibility and potential still remain theoretical.</p> 
<p>Reviewers noted that the rotary vapor compression cycle (RVCC) technology being developed is not a new concept, but has been around “for several decades,” although one reviewer described this effort as one of the larger efforts so far. One reviewer described the project as fundamental research, with the project team attempting to establish feasibility. Reviewers noted good initial investigation results with identification of a research area, namely, the effect of centrifugal and Coriolis forces on refrigerants in a rotating heat exchanger. One reviewer said it “might be warranted” to explore using very low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants.</p>
<p>Another reviewer offered the technical criticism that the project team has only looked at the “easy parts so far [air side heat transfer]” while not yet addressing the compressor side and expressed little confidence that a working prototype could be developed by the September 2016 time frame described in the presentation. One reviewer recommended the project team bring in a vapor-compressing cooling systems manufacturing partner for the prototype design phase of the work, especially given outstanding questions of economical manufacturing. Overall, the project received generally good marks for integration and collaboration with good research organizations involved and appropriate partners at this stage of development.</p>
<p>For future work, while one reviewer believed the team has a well-developed plan for the next six years of research, another feared the team has “seriously underestimate[d] the difficulties they will face in addressing the refrigerant side of the problem” and expressed skepticism that this will be done within the budget or current timeframe.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt that the project was relevant to BTO’s goals, noting that the project outcome of developing an integrated substrate to replace traditional materials for the fabrication of low-cost, high-efficiency OLEDs was consistent with BTO’s target of achieving a light efficiency of 200 lumens per watt (lm/W) by 2020. They also felt that the project mostly addresses cost, a primary barrier to high-adoption rates for light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Reviewers gave the project high marks on the impressive progress to date, project approach, appropriate stakeholders, and great initial results.</p> 
<p>One reviewer felt that the project approach was promising, in particular the effort to develop a scalable, low-cost process to fabricate an organic LED (OLED) substrate that integrates high surface conductivity, low surface roughness, and high light extraction efficiency in a plastic sheet using silver nanowires (Ag NWs). However, this same reviewer felt that the atomic layer deposition (ALD) process might be too expensive for a large-area, low-cost application. Another reviewer felt that the project approach and objectives will overcome significant market barriers, providing improvements in performance, cost, and efficiency.</p>
<p>The reviewers offered praise for both the accomplishments and project integration/collaboration. For the former, they noted the project has demonstrated very good results so far, including achieving 80 lm/W efficacy at 1000 candela per square meter (cd/m2) using the integrated plastic substrate. The reviewers also noted that the project team has worked closely with the manufacturer OLEDWorks and has the necessary expertise and partners in academia and industry to achieve success – and to modify processes when needed.</p> 
<p>Reviewers did comment that the use of ALD as a process is potentially too costly for low-cost, large-area manufacturing of integrated substrates. Another reviewer questioned how the project would go forward in reaching the target light efficiency value of 150 lm/W and whether the Ag NWs would tarnish over time.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>University of California at Los Angeles will continue this project on an integrated substrate based off plastic with silver nanowires. The goal is to provide light extraction enhancement, sealing, and current management. The project has achieved 80 lm/W at 1000 cd/m2 with this integrated plastic substrate, and will conclude at the end of 2016. DOE’s Acquisition and Project Management (APM) guidance will be used to wrap up.</p> "

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to DOE’s goals, describing that self-powered sensors would be an excellent addition to building systems in terms of monitoring and controlling energy use. Reviewers also generally agreed with the project’s approach, though with certain reservations. One reviewer noted that people would definitely be interested in cheaper and low/no-maintenance sensors, while another commented on the novelty and relevance of the piezoelectric energy harvesting idea.</p> 
<p>However, one reviewer flagged that the sensor was limited, in that it had to be co-located with a vibration source, while another highlighted that the approach would have benefited from a consideration of sample frequency and the application of a model predictive control strategy that could enhance sensor lifetime. One reviewer felt that the project demonstrated no real innovation, however, and instead merely integrated an established piezoelectric harvester with existing sensors and communication packages.</p>
<p>In terms of accomplishments, reviewers highlighted that the project team had successfully built a prototype sensor, exceeded original impact goals, and received several awards from outside agencies. However, one reviewer flagged that most of these accomplishment were primarily related to student activities and demonstrated little actual technology development. This reviewer further commented that they were not satisfied with the small amount of data that was shown to support the work of the sensors, given that the data presented were exclusively related to power consumption rather than sensor reliability, detection failures, communication failures, etc.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project appeared to have very little outside collaboration, including very little industry involvement, and that the project was primarily an effort of a single university and a spin-off company. Further, one reviewer commented that the project team’s presentation demonstrated that they were not familiar with the requirements of the building controls or HVAC industry, signaling that some real industry partners would be valuable.</p> 
<p>Looking forward, reviewers noted that with testing of the fundamental apparatus complete, further miniaturization of the device and the pursuit of venture capital made sense. However, one reviewer commented that, because the sensor’s wireless functionality still had to be tested and fully implemented, the project team was still in the product development phase, rather than the “commercialization” phase described in the presentation. Another reviewer recommended that the project team should continue to investigate whether improvements can be made to the underlying technologies (e.g., piezoelectric (PZE) harvesting, form factor) to add value beyond the project’s current strategy of packaging together existing technologies.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, noting that the project’s potential for improving building system efficiency and reliability through low-cost fault detection was directly aligned with BTO objectives, particularly if it could be done without installing expensive sensing and control equipment.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers expressed that the project’s approach – which was focused on fault detection in HVAC systems – had merit, but also that it faced several significant risks. Reviewers commented that the approach had a lot of promise, especially when combined with other fault detection techniques. However, one reviewer cautioned that using power signature identification for energy loads was difficult, as many combinations of devices could produce similar signatures. Reviewers acknowledged that the basic software capability had been validated in test buildings, but they warned that translating this success to real buildings would be challenging.</p> 
<p>One reviewer noted that aging effects and variance in equipment can change a device’s power signature from building to building, and that figuring out how to establish a good baseline for a specific building was going to be difficult. This reviewer felt that the project’s technology might not be able to implement successful HVAC fault detection on its own, but instead it could be a powerful addition to other sensed data, some of which was already present in existing control systems. Another reviewer commented that actual fault detection data was not yet available, but would be important to generating more confidence in the project.</p>
<p>A third reviewer noted that if it the project’s fault detection software could be used reliably, it could be deployed to buildings immediately because there would be little cost in terms of new investment. However, another reviewer commented that, while the software could work well in smaller buildings with limited HVAC loads and no adequately trained maintenance staff, larger buildings with multiple HVAC units would not be good candidates.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project appeared to feature only light collaboration, though one reviewer surmised that additional collaboration may not have been needed based on scope. One reviewer offered further comment that the limited collaboration appeared heavy on academia and consultants, and recommended that the project team consider also partnering with manufacturers and businesses.</p> 
<p>Overall, reviewers expressed mixed feelings on the project’s proposed future work. One reviewer believed that limitations were presented and progress was shown with timelines for the next milestone, while another reviewer felt that the project lacked a strong vision going forward. One reviewer noted that it seemed like a preliminary software package would be ready for real building tests soon, and that the outcome of this testing would determine the readiness of the proposed solution. This reviewer expressed concerns, however, that if the software package did not work well in a real-world setting, no fallback solution was presented for salvaging the analytical techniques developed.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers gave EnergyPlus high marks for its relevance to BTO’s mission and goals, with one reviewer describing it as an “indispensable” energy modeling engine that is the “basis for almost every technology evaluation in the BTO mission.” Similar sentiments were given in reviewers’ assessment of the program’s strengths with one reviewer writing, “As ‘best in class’ software for determining predictions of energy usage, EnergyPlus remains a core component in DOE’s strategy for providing platforms for software vendors to build off of.” Other reviewers remarked that EnergyPlus was now an “international tool” with a “great” performance testing framework that “continues to become more and more useful and accurate as time goes on.” Reviewers praised the integration with OpenStudio and with other DOE tools and programs.</p>
<p>The lowest overall score was for project approach, mostly due to reviewer’s disagreeing with the relevance of the evaluation criteria for EnergyPlus’ mission and impact. One reviewer noted that addressing “critical market barriers” is not applicable because it is an ongoing effort to improve a piece of software, while another wrote that EnergyPlus itself is designed to overcome the major market barrier of the capability to analyze energy performance with a high level of accuracy.</p> 
<p>A third reviewer viewed insufficient energy model control design integration as a critical market barrier and noted that no activity was proposed on how to support EnergyPlus energy modeling under actual building operations. This reviewer specifically pointed to key needs such as “taking into account the stochastic behavior of occupants” and how to handle improving the model’s capabilities for “integrative/batch simulation purposes required for population-based probabilistic numerical optimization and uncertainty-sensitivity analysis.” However, when the stochastic question was raised during the question and answer (Q&A) session, the presenter replied that EnergyPlus was developing occupant behavior models “integrated through co-simulation.”</p>
<p>Reviewers were generally pleased with the EnergyPlus team’s collaboration with industry, though a few were concerned with the relationship between DOE and one major industry user of the tool, potentially giving the appearance of supporting a single company more than others. Overall reviewers were impressed with plans to continue to build out functionality (recent accomplishments including LaTeX, C++, JSON input, and code compliance check), use-cases, and a second-generation version of the tool (Spawn-of-EnergyPlus) and pointed to the past success and the growing number of downloads under DOE hands with ensuring quality and rigor.</p> 
<p>However, some reviewers were concerned with the ability of the EnergyPlus team to accomplish all of its planned improvements in the coming years with its current level of support. Reviewers pointed to a lack of formal management plans and procedures for addressing bugs, prioritizing and adding new functionality, the availability of overall software user documentation (specifically, how components interact with each other), and the transition between EnergyPlus and Spawn-of-EnergyPlus as project weaknesses in accomplishing the multitude of proposed future projects. One reviewer, however, did note that that a flexible management approach is key for EnergyPlus to be responsive to market needs. Another reviewer proposed creating a formal advisory board that is focused on market-needs to help prioritize improvement needs.</p>
<p>One suggested a different evaluation mechanism from the Peer Review might be useful for EnergyPlus that split the review into a half day devoted to technical experts and a half-day with market representatives such as architects, engineers, developers, and facility managers.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>EnergyPlus is a long running project that will continue into the foreseeable future. In response to prior year reviews, the team has created a better and more transparent process for collecting and incorporating user feedback and synthesizing requirements. That channel (implemented via the UserVoice site http://energyplus.uservoice.com/) is being put to the test in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 planning process. DOE and the EnergyPlus team has also established tighter communication channels with third party vendors.</p>
<p>Concerns about the unknown aspects of the large impending Spawn-of-EnergyPlus transition are legitimate. DOE and the team are well aware of them. To mitigate risk, the team is pursuing a somewhat parallel development strategy for a number of years before completely switching over. The OpenStudio software development kit also mitigates transition risk by acting as a mediator between EnergyPlus and client applications and users.</p>
<p>Empirical validation of existing and new EnergyPlus models is an important task, but it is not a part of the EnergyPlus project proper. It is addressed in two other projects, ""ASHRAE Standard 140"" and ""Empirical Validation and Uncertainty Characterization,"" neither of which were reviewed this year. Related education and community collaboration projects were also not reviewed. Suggestion for alternate peer review structure for EnergyPlus (and maybe other large long-standing projects) is well taken and will be considered for implementation next year.</p>
<p>It is difficult to attach traditional performance metrics (i.e., the types of metrics that are attached to physical widgets such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and windows, in particular, installed cost and lumens-per-watt or U-value) to software projects as well as to account for energy savings. Rather for software, DOE focuses on deployment and use metrics. Current DOE metrics for EnergyPlus (and OpenStudio) use the American Institute of Architects (AIA) 2030 Commitment reporting data to measure use in design and energy savings over code-baseline. DOE will investigate other potential metrics and sources of data for tracking EnergyPlus use.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>In seeking to develop and validate simulation models, develop test methods and procedures, and develop web-based tools for rating the energy performance of window attachments, reviewers strongly agreed this project supported BTO’s goals. Reviewers said by helping manufacturers and consumers develop and select the best energy saving fenestration attachments in quantifiable terms, this project would provide a “technical backbone” for the Attachments Energy Rating Council (AERC), help new fenestration attachments into the market, and ultimately help achieve high performance buildings.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed the project approach seemed well-thought out and executed, with key issues identified and a clear plan for testing, measuring, and incorporation into simulation methods identified. Many reviewers agreed the approach seemed likely to enable cost-effective rating tools.</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the research team appeared to have a strong and excellent collaboration among multiple partners and subcontractors with good connections with industry/manufacturers. One reviewer, however, found the relationship between the project and AERC to be insufficient.</p> 
<p>Reviewers strongly agreed the project deliverables will be useful in getting energy efficient fenestration attached to the market, which could be quite large, and will help various stakeholders “make informed decisions on product specification, policy making, [and] new product development.” One reviewer praised the validated simulation models and their incorporation into associated software tools as an alternative to physical testing, but another reviewer questioned the linkages of the project to targeted labeling programs.</p> 
<p>Proposed future work received high marks with a “clear plan and meaningful activities” on both the technical and organizational side and included a variety of stakeholders such as certification agencies, consumer groups, and manufacturers. Reviewers questioned if a simpler and more user-friendly program could be developed to promote wider adoption into the market, with one reviewer suggesting a web-based program could be developed to allow the public to easily use this program to evaluate window attachments.</p>
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>The reviewer comments of AERC and their presentation were somewhat more critical than for Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL’s) presentation of the technical work underpinning the ratings program coordinated by AERC. The focus on technical work in LBNL’s presentation as compared to the Window Covering Manufacturers Association (WCMA) could be the source of the difference in reviewer appraisals of the two presentations, even though they were simply presenting the project from two perspectives. With respect to the comments on this presentation, it is expected that AERC will develop the web-based program that one of the reviewers described, to make it easy for consumers/building owners to get information about the energy performance of the window attachments they plan to purchase or specify.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers were decidedly mixed in their evaluation of this project. However, they generally felt this project was relevant to BTO goals given the project’s stated outcomes including (1) assessing current and future opportunities for thermal non-vapor compression (VC) heat pumping technologies versus conventional systems; (2) identifying the various drivers impacting their adoption; and (3) determining what portions of the heat pumping technology supply chain the U.S. has or could capture. One reviewer differed from this consensus, stating that it was difficult to see how any of the objectives were addressed given that nearly the entire presentation of the project discussed conventional heat pump manufacturing. Additionally, one reviewer noted that the project excludes ground source heat pumps, a technology that “can already meet” BTO goals.</p>
<p>While reviewers may have disagreed in their evaluations, there ended up being general consensus that the approach of this project, including the approach to critical market barriers, was average. One reviewer expressed concern that the approach focused too much on air source heat pump manufacturing as being independent of air conditioning manufacturing and another stated that the project, while helpfully informational, was unlikely to overcome barriers.</p> 
<p>Reviewers viewed the project as a start in helping the industry transition to non-VC heat pump technologies and one that could indirectly meet BTO goals provided the approach uses the right set of assumptions. One reviewer observed that the non-VC technologies portion of the project is now complete and current work is focusing on magnetocaloric refrigeration – the development of which would indeed be a transformative contribution to program market goals.</p>
<p>While some reviewers felt there was an appropriate level of stakeholder engagement, others found collaboration in this project, especially with manufacturers, lacking.</p> 
<p>Reviewers thought this project could serve as a good tool for examining manufacturing and market barriers for this technology and that it provides information on heat pump manufacturing not otherwise available.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, but one reviewer expressed serious reservations about the likelihood that this technology would have significant impact in the United States, and felt that the presentation did not make a compelling case for carbon dioxide (CO2)-based refrigeration systems. Reviewers also generally agreed that the project’s approach was appropriate, noting that taking a system-wide approach to improving efficiency and technology was reasonable, that most critical barriers had been identified and were being overcome, and that the project’s program for testing the technology was well laid out.</p> 
<p>Here too, however, one reviewer had serious misgivings, commenting that cost barriers had not been realistically addressed, and that because the system performed poorly at higher ambient temperatures it was an unsuitable technology for large areas of the U.S. One reviewer recommended that the project’s modeling should take into account the full range of outdoor operating temperatures, especially on rooftops and in hot climates, as the technology’s reported coefficient of performance (COP) is worse than existing systems above 90°F.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted that the supermarket refrigeration system being developed by this project – described as a proven technology in Europe – has exceeded the project’s energy and emissions savings targets, that the project was very likely to contribute to the BTO Emerging Technologies (ET) Program’s interim market goal, and that the project had accomplished much in terms of increasing component and system performance efficiencies. Other reviewers described the project’s work as transformative within the limits of the market's use of the particular refrigeration system configurations, and another reviewer highlighted that the primary question at this point was how large the market penetration would actually be. One reviewer dissented with the majority, however, describing that while the project’s approach to the problem was good, the results were not positive.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project’s future plans were appropriate, though one reviewer noted that it was unclear from the presentation whether certain milestones scheduled for the end of 2014 had been met. One reviewer commented that it was imperative for the project team to explore system limitations and efficiencies across the full range of operating ambient temperatures, but noted that this would be supported through field testing.</p> 
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed on the strength of the project’s collaborations and partnerships, commenting that the project had demonstrated an excellent level of understanding of key stakeholders, and also had assembled an impressive number of interested industrial partners.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers disagreed on the relevance of the project to BTO’s goals. One reviewer expressed that the development of magnetocaloric refrigeration technology was very relevant to BTO’s program goals. However, a different reviewer felt that the project was not yet sufficiently developed to determine if the technology could be successful overall, while another commented that current ENERGY STAR refrigerator energy use was so low that this project’s technology would have to have minimal incremental cost relative to traditional compressor systems to achieve market penetration. Another reviewer noted that the project report had focused on the manufacture of magnetocaloric heat exchangers, whereas it presented little evidence that an energy efficiency improvement can be reached.</p>
<p>Though one reviewer identified this technology as one of the most promising and innovative being investigated, others felt that a path to commercialization was not being sufficiently pursued. One reviewer commented that they had been presented with information only on manufacturing work, rather than performance data, so any market barriers related to efficiency were not addressed. Another described that because the project had focused primarily on getting the cooling output targeted, there were a whole lineup of potentially new barriers that might need to be addressed. Finally, one reviewer noted that while a compressor had been eliminated, there would still be a power supply, valves, and pumps that might have reliability issues.</p>
<p>Regarding the project’s accomplishments, one reviewer described the magnetocaloric science as being well demonstrated and advanced, but warned that it was too early to know whether the science and technology could be implemented in a marketable and reliable product. Other reviewers echoed this warning, noting that there was still work to do to show that interim market goals could be achieved with such a different approach, and that there were a number of other issues and obstacles that had to be resolved, some of which likely had not yet been identified.</p>
<p>Numerous reviewers agreed on the importance of the project team’s collaboration with GE, describing this partnership as wise, significant, and highly appropriate. However, one reviewer expressed misgiving regarding the broader collaboration environment, describing that it was not clear where there was an effective dialog with the industry that would have to adopt this technology. This reviewer recommended taking a more holistic approach to integration and collaboration could prevent the project from going down a dead end.</p>
<p>In terms of the project’s ongoing work plan, one reviewer commented that the project’s future work on manufacturing was appropriate, whereas another reviewer was worried that implementation of the technology into a product was not part of the current project. One reviewer commented that major steps and milestones were still to be undertaken, while another recommended broadening the project scope so that a more complete evaluation of the technology’s viability could be made. Similarly, another reviewer asked to see a more in depth analysis of the practicality of the overall technology package, so that a preliminary analysis could be made on the likelihood of meeting performance and cost-effectiveness program goals.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project was relevant to BTO’s mission and goals, both in terms of its advancement of innovative enabling technologies as well as its potential for energy savings. One reviewer noted, however, that despite its potential success in these arenas, the project did not address the more recent goal of moving to low-global warming potential (GWP) working fluids.</p> 
<p>In terms of approach, reviewers described the market barriers being addressed as first cost and operating cost, as well as cold-climate heat pump operations. One reviewer remarked that the project team had identified these critical market barriers, assessed them quantitatively, and had oriented the product research and development appropriately. However, a different reviewer noted that barriers related to delivered-air temperature and thermal comfort were not addressed, while another felt that it would have been helpful if actual dollar amounts had been included for cost, both for the project’s developed technologies as well as for its competition (e.g., variable speed systems). In addition, one reviewer commented that the project laboratory and field testing methodologies should have been elaborated in more detail in order to justify the project’s claimed benefits.</p>
<p>For accomplishments, reviewers noted that prototype testing had confirmed a 40% reduction in daily energy use at the coldest conditions, and that a coefficient of performance (COP) of greater than 2 had been achieved. Reviewers described that all test prototypes demonstrated compliance with established project goals, and felt that additional data from an upcoming Alaska field test would help further verify progress. Although technology advances were largely incremental, reviewers felt that the results were still significant, and might provide the bump in efficiency to make heat pump systems more attractive to the U.S. market. One reviewer noted that there were still some cost-effectiveness challenges, while another commented that the team should try to further isolate the contribution of the heat pump to observed declines in utility bills.</p>
<p>Reviewers described the broader project team – led by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) – as being quite impressive and including all necessary expertise and experiences, with one reviewer commenting that the project had identified and was working with key stakeholders. One reviewer thought that the role of these stakeholders should have been more clearly defined so as to better understand project coordination, while another felt that it would have been interesting had the project team engaged with other stakeholders, including system integrators, other heat pump manufacturers, and electric utilities.</p> 
<p>Looking forward, reviewers thought that the project was nearly complete, and that final field testing data should provide a satisfactory conclusion and assessment of the project’s ability to achieve its stated goals. Reviewers also agreed with the project’s follow-on commercialization activities. One reviewer wanted the project team to further clarify the criteria used during the comparison of the proposed system against existing cold-climate heat pump units, while another reviewer recommended engaging certification bodies in the testing process to avoid possible re-designs. Finally, one reviewer noted that it might be valuable to investigate if lessons learned here could be applied to low-GWP refrigerant systems.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed on the relevance of this project to BTO’s program goals, both in terms of advancing an innovative enabling technology as well as the technology’s potential to lower energy consumption while reducing use of high-global warming potential (GWP) fluids in HVAC/water heating systems. Reviewers also generally agreed on the appropriateness of the project team’s approach, with one highlighting that the project team had identified critical market barriers, assessed them quantitatively, and oriented the product research and development accordingly. One reviewer did feel that the project focused on cost – specifically developing carbon dioxide (CO2) heat pumps at a price point that was viable for the U.S. residential market – at the expense of other relevant barriers to the technology. In addition, this reviewer felt that no information was provided regarding experimental or analytical work on balance-of-plant, whereas the reviewer felt that significant cost reductions and energy improvements could be realized in other components (e.g., suction line, heat exchanger, compressor, valves, controls, etc.).</p>
<p>Reviewers identified four main accomplishments to date, including the simulation, selection, fabrication, and evaluation of a design. However, many reviewers noted that while the project appears to have met many targets in terms of cost and performance, the presentation was nearly identical to a presentation given in 2014; reviewers felt that it was not clear what accomplishments or progress has been made over the past two years. Reviewers recommended that, in the future, the project team should make clear the distinction between past and current project activities.</p>
<p>Reviewers lauded the project team’s extensive integration activities, including their publications, presentations, and technical/business communications, and highlighted that the project’s partnership with GE Appliances was particularly attractive for commercialization of the technology. One reviewer felt that GE’s role was unclear, however, while another commented that partnerships with HVAC original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) would have been valuable.</p>
<p>Reviewers highlighted that a majority of project work was complete, and that a clear path for future work had been set, to include the final uniform energy factor (UEF) evaluation and final reporting. Reviewers offered several recommendations as the project moved towards closing, including to (1) consider preparing journal papers based on the results, so that others in the community could learn from the research efforts; (2) engage certification parties into the final UEF testing to avoid possible re-designs during certification; and (3) use the final report to clarify some of the selection criteria for the final system design, as well as to identify the main drivers for the final system realization (efficiency, cost, low GWP, reliability, safety, etc.).</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the relevance and alignment of this project to BTO’s program goals, highlighting that water heaters make up a significant portion of the energy consumption for some commercial building types. Reviewers were mixed on the project’s approach, however. Some reviewers described the project’s approach as very worthwhile and a well-chosen first effort, while others felt that relevant and important market barriers were not discussed, including first cost, constraints related to building layouts, and maintenance/service issues. Another reviewer felt that it was not reasonable to assume that the project’s efforts would encourage entries into the market, a consequence of the technology’s high cost relative to its modest reductions in energy use. In addition, one reviewer expressed a desire to see the efficiency measurement and rating process reexamined, specifically looking at whether the proposed system’s booster tank would be an integral system component, and therefore would need to have its performance considered as part of the system’s efficiency.</p>
<p>In terms of progress, reviewers agreed that the project had provided a good demonstration of technology, with one reviewer commenting that the project’s alpha test showed good performance approaching target levels, while another commended the project team for testing to outdoor temperatures as low as 8°F. One reviewer cautioned, however, that a big barrier that would need to be overcome to achieve market goals was the fragmentation of the market in terms of equipment sizes required for different applications. Another reviewer pointedly commented that the envisioned product would likely not save substantial energy, and was therefore unlikely to achieve any meaningful market penetration.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project offered a good demonstration of collaboration with partners, including A.O. Smith and SMTI, which together have provided component and system design, fabrication, testing, testing support, market research, and cost share. Despite the collaboration that was present, however, one reviewer felt it was hard to see how the project would result in a successful product given the absence of engagement with the maintenance and repair community.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that an appropriate work plan was presented for the project moving forward. However, reviewers did offer numerous recommendations for additions or adjustments that the project team should consider for future work including (1) that future work should field test several monitored units in different applications, to help discover operating conditions that were not anticipated; and (2) that attention should be paid to how the unit defrosts its outdoor coil during cold weather operation, as defrost controls can get complicated. One reviewer also recommended the project should be completed as soon as possible, so that the results can be made public to the gas appliance community for any further action on this community’s part.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the development of printable low-cost sensors aligned well with BTO's goals. Reviewers commented that low-cost sensors could help make energy management systems more affordable, and therefore more attractive to install, and that solving wireless integration issues was both relevant and needed. Reviewers also generally agreed on the project’s approach, alternatively describing the approach as solid and effective in reaching its goal. One highlighted that difficulties in printing sensors were well documented, that all barriers were identified, and that the project’s designs appeared to address most of the issues. Another reviewer warned that some of the sensors might require geometry beyond two-dimensional (2D) and noted that better integration of foreign parts or the use of three-dimensional (3D) printing might be helpful. A third reviewer highlighted that key issues like sensor accuracy and drift were not addressed, but acknowledged that these issues might be irrelevant due to sensor price and short service life.</p>
<p>Reviewers felt that the project had achieved good results thus far. They highlighted that the nature of the work and the accomplishments were directed more at solving a fundamental problem, and described that the project team was on a good path in this regard. Another reviewer was impressed with the almost-to-market quality of the project’s sensor prototype. One reviewer was pleased that the functionality and cost of the sensor’s various integrated parts were detailed, but thought that the Peer Review presentation was heavy on antenna-related elements, whereas additional performance data on sensor component would have been valued. Overall, reviewers felt that the project had great promise to release a low-cost sensor to market within the next couple of years. In this vein, one reviewer encouraged the project team to drive toward completion in order to compare the project’s final deliverables with the state-of-art.</p>
<p>In terms of collaboration, reviewers remarked that the project team had worked very closely with partner Molex on the development of the sensor product, and the fact that Molex was able to produce such a high-quality prototype spoke to the quality of this collaboration. One reviewer did note, however, that there did not seem to be significant collaborations beyond Molex, noting that the project might have benefited from also partnering with an end-user who could deploy the sensors. However, this reviewer acknowledged that perhaps the project was primarily focused on producing the sensor, not testing it.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, reviewers noted that the project team’s plans to wrap up the project seemed well within reach. One reviewer noted that it was likely that the inclusion of humidity and temperature sensors would be tricky, but that all signs pointed toward the challenge being solved. However, this reviewer remarked that because there was no plan to actually test sensors in real buildings, nor to perform any lifetime assessments, the project team will not know how long the project’s sensors will last.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on the relevance of this project to BTO’s goals, with half rating it an “outstanding” project and the other half rating it “fair.” Supporting reviewers cited the relevance of advanced building technologies and techniques to BTO’s mission, while dissenting reviewers questioned how helping buildings in the Indian market aligns with BTO’s domestic energy goals. One reviewer praised expected deliverables from this project to help the target audience (building officials, architects, building owners and developers) make informed decisions on energy saving products.</p>
<p>Reviewers questioned the lack of information presented on overcoming cost barriers as well as not properly addressing phase change material (PCM) characteristics: toxicity, melting point, auto ignition temperature, flammability, and volume change during phase change. Reviewers recommended sharing additional details on how PCM characteristics were measured and validated as well as defining a cost per square foot for the proposed materials. Other reviewers were positive about leveraging Indian investment for U.S. market benefit and the computational simulations and experiments conducted by the project team.</p>
<p>Reviewers expressed uncertainty about accomplishments with comments on a lack of clarity with respect to measurement of PCM characteristics, that it was too early to assess any market impacts, the limited usefulness of the results to BTO’s goals, and oversimplification of modeled systems. By contrast, reviewers were generally pleased with project collaboration and integration with a strong and well-balanced team as reflected in field experiments and joint papers.</p> 
<p>Reviewers recommended that the project incorporate additional modeling efforts to ensure the project has significant impact, as well as increased collaboration with Indian partners to ensure all project partners understand the challenges and critical barriers in India. Reviewers also recommended a detailed plan for measuring PCM thermo-physical characteristics and creation of anticipated quantitative and qualitative targets to evaluate project success.</p> 
<p>Program Response:</p>
<p>CBERD projects are intended to promote scientific research collaboration for diplomatic and technical objectives that provide mutual benefit to the U.S. and India. To that end, while the portfolio on the whole seeks to balance those benefits, some tasks and sub-tasks might be more weighted towards benefits for the U.S. or India. As an example, the PCM project will likely have greater application in India, where natural ventilation and mixed-mode building operations (i.e., using natural ventilation in conjunction with mechanical HVAC systems) are far more common and PCMs can help improve performance in those operating regimes. The treatment of the PCM characteristics noted above is somewhat limited given the budget constraints of the U.S. side of the project, but the challenges of PCMs have been communicated to the Indian research partners.</p> 
<p>While it might not have been conveyed fully, the U.S. and Indian partners have been in close collaboration to ensure that the work conducted is consistent with the nuances and challenges of the Indian market and building-related industries. This sensitivity is aided by the fact that the bulk of the work is being conducted by the Indian research teams.</p>"

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments:</p> 
<p>Reviewers were split on the relevance of this U.S.-India Joint Center for Building Energy Research and Development (CBERD) project towards BTO’s goals. While reviewers agreed that the work could result in benefits for the Indian market and power grid, they did not see value for the work in the U.S. market unless there was a better interface to control price or power demand. Reviewers generally were positive towards the project’s utilization of the VOLTTRON platform and the approach for the Indian market, but they worried that due to prevailing norms in the U.S. HVAC industry this project’s approach and lack of cost data would never result in widespread, global impact. Reviewers were also concerned that the project would require a significant amount of education and behavioral change to be included in the work to enable cutting individual loads on and off, given that plugging a non-dimmable load into the wrong outlet will burn out the load.</p> 
<p>Reviewers praised the demonstration and product development work for the Indian market, noting that should the technology be developed at the envisioned low price-point, it could be industry changing. Reviewers were generally positive on the Indian partnership involved in the project, with one saying the high degree of U.S. – India collaboration “is the shining part of this effort” and said such internationally collaborative projects in the future could have a major impact.</p>
<p>Many of the project reviewers’ criticisms centered on the impact of the technology in the U.S., with reviewers noting it remained unclear how the project demonstrations could impact the U.S. market. Several reviewers noted there was no real U.S. industry participation and recommended reaching out to more U.S. industries for their perspective on market development. Reviewers were concerned across categories as to the lack of this project’s articulated value to the U.S. and the DOE.</p> 
<p>Reviewers also expressed skepticism on elements of project management, with concerns centering on unrealistic timelines, a lack of planning, and insufficient budget for the scope of work to no behavioral change component in an effort that requires user education. One reviewer remarked that the project appeared to lack a unifying theme, worrying the project team was unwilling to coalesce around a single technology research project and working more on technology integration issues. Finally, one reviewer recommended looking for any technology transfer from India to a U.S. manufacturer.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Project</p> 
<p>Reviewers felt this project was relevant to the BTO portfolio, and an important issue in existing homes. However, two reviewers expressed concerns about the overall impact of the project in the residential market. Reviewers generally agreed that the accuracy of combustion safety testing could be improved, and that this study contributed valuable knowledge that may help the market reduce the potential for false positive combustion safety tests. While one reviewer noted that this project was successfully completed, the others agreed that the number of test homes was insufficient to have a meaningful impact. Reviewers concurred that key stakeholders were generally well represented, and collaboration with industry and relevant partners was apparent and benefitted the project. Reviewers agreed that though the project was complete, the researcher had identified pertinent areas of further study to expand upon this project.</p> 
<p>One reviewer commented that this study was the first of its kind to address reducing false positive combustion safety tests and that it found, through field testing, that many failures are due to system install deficiencies, not exhaust ventilation. The study scratched the surface of the potential for improving false positive combustion safety test results. Another reviewer thought the project’s strength was that these results are being integrated into standards and best practices, while a different reviewer felt that addressing the important issue of energy savings impact was the project’s strongest aspect. Reviewers recommended broadening the field test in general to increase the number of homes tested, but also to include greater house diversity. The narrow sample size was the main concern of the reviewers throughout the review, and thus for any future studies, their primary suggestion focused on increasing and broadening the sample size.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project is relevant to the Residential Buildings Integration (RBI) Program roadmap, with the potential to change the industry if this work is successful. Reviewers agreed that most barriers and limits to implementation were well addressed and that the overall approach of this project was well thought out and implemented. However, one reviewer pointed out that at this stage of the project, a more advanced understanding of how to overcome plastic ductwork fire code barriers or significant progress towards that end would be expected, as well as an assessment of the energy needed to operate such a system. Another reviewer commented that code barriers are larger than the technical barriers, so solutions that can address the need for smaller diameter ducts systems should focus on materials and performance acceptable in the code.</p> 
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the potential for this project if it is successful will have a large impact on the design and installation of HVAC duct systems in low-load homes and improve overall indoor air quality (IAQ). At this stage in the project, the majority of reviewers felt that project integration and collaboration was appropriate, with the exception of the lack of some builder and manufacturer engagement, even on a test level. Two reviewers felt the proposed future work was well thought out and appropriate, while the other two reviewers thought more needed to be addressed. One thought zone dampers were a huge opportunity to build into future demonstrations. Another asked what other system solutions are possible, such as ducted mini splits. One reviewer commented that this project represents a potential and relatively simple solution to a long-term vexing problem of good HVAC duct design and conditioned air delivery.</p> 
<p>Reviewers wanted to know more quantifiable information, such as the potential per home savings compared to traditional ducting. Another reviewer wondered when this equipment would be broadly available in the market for this type of system.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project is relevant to key issues identified in Residential Buildings Integration (RBI) Program  roadmaps and the BTO Multi-Year Program Plan. A reviewer commented that better defining the latent and sensible load control needs of low-load homes is critical to the future of low-load home construction. Relatively little information has been developed over the years and this research program squarely addresses this lack of information. . However, one reviewer questioned whether a new modeling tool will result in a change to building practices since we have known how to build low-load passive homes for 40 years, noting concerns about the high cost of developing modeling tools to confirm what is already known.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that this program addresses gaps in knowledge regarding low-load homes, especially regarding properly sizing equipment and evaluating moisture absorption and buffering. However, one reviewer thought there was much to be done before it can be used by a building designer or HVAC contractor. Reviewers agreed that project integration and collaboration was generally appropriate for this stage, but suggested including more manufacturing partners, as well as working with Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) staff who work in the same or related areas. Reviewers agreed that the heavy reliance on computer modeling needs to be kept in check, by using as much real world experience and data as possible, especially through trades and builders. A reviewer highly recommended evaluation of the thermal buffering capacity of the house and consideration of changes to materials used to increase both moisture and thermal capacity in low-load homes as a way to decrease the number of hours the house operates outside of the comfort range without the need to increase HVAC size and complexity. Another reviewer approved of the focus on the ACCA manual J and S practices, but wanted to see some assessment of the size of the market not using ACCA manuals and how to approach that market.</p>

<p>Relevance: 3.75    Approach: 3.63   Accomplishments: 3.13  Project Collaboration: 3.63   Future Work: 3.50</p>
<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project is relevant to BTO’s portfolio since healthy efficient homes are an important and often misunderstood aspect of low energy development. They agreed that indoor air quality (IAQ), especially in low-load homes, was an important area that builders needed to consider and homeowners needed to understand. There was general consensus among the reviewers that this project took an appropriate approach in addressing IAQ by conducting the right research and development (R&D), although one reviewer commented that cost impacts were not discussed. One reviewer commented that this project was filling information gaps that have the potential to lead to changes in industry standards, while another claimed the results are still too developmental and do not indicate clear cost/benefit solutions. Reviewers agreed that key stakeholders were actively involved in the project, though one reviewer commented that builders were not adequately represented.</p>
<p>Proposed future work was well thought out, built well on work already completed and addressed many of the concerns mentioned in the review. The reviewers agreed that this project had strong R&D capabilities, well qualified staff and engaged partners to develop market solutions. One reviewer found that the major weakness with the project was the lack of builder partners. Another did not see the level of risks clearly demonstrated. One reviewer acknowledged staff participation in IAQ standards committees to enable them to quickly move the results of the project into a position to impact the market.</p> 
<p>A third reviewer focused more on broader communication, claiming many in the industry simply do not understand what the potential risks are and therefore will likely fight the adoption of new requirements that cost dollars, so this project needs to find a way to better educate all in the chain to home owners, including homeowners.</p>

<p>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</p>
<p>Reviewers felt the relevance of this project was limited due to similar already commercialized products on the market, limited market appeal, and limited applicability. In regards to approach, reviewers agreed that market penetration and homeowner and contractor awareness should be addressed, possibly through demonstrations. One reviewer commented on the lack of information provided on the potential cost to operational savings. Additionally, there were testing concerns since field tests were performed in Alaska, and reviewers felt they should be supplemented with testing in more typical zones for these systems (such as the Midwest). Finally, regarding approach, one reviewer wanted to see more assessment of needed training/technological barriers to full scale implementation.</p> 
<p>One reviewer saw success more likely with the integrated hot water system because it would serve the area of the country that most new homes are built. Another reviewer thought this technology was premature to be included in the RBI portfolio until there was preproduction/production models available to be tested in homes. Reviewers concurred there was a good level of manufacturer involvement, the main stakeholder at this stage in the project. One reviewer was impressed with the potential for these technologies, but commented that non-technical barriers should be addressed in the research program moving forward. Another reviewer concurred with the performers plan not to propose further work on this project upon completion of field testing in 2016.</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that integrating HVAC and hot water systems was a creative solution, as long as the equipment were close to each other. One reviewer mentioned this project could be an important tool for utilities to have when seeking additional ways to shave peak demand loads, and that using existing technology means little additional training for a ready workforce. There were overarching reviewer concerns of market adoption due to market gas prices, advances in mini-split system manufacturers and installers, applicability especially in the retrofit market, and the two compressor system versus traditional one compressor systems. One reviewer recommended performing a study to determine the benefits of retrofitting the advanced variable speed air-source integrated heat pump (AS-IPH) product to each type of HVAC system as this may greatly increase its market potential. Another reviewer commented that HVAC systems sometimes run into challenges with working over the long term, and thus testing of environmental stress and operational stress must also be demonstrated to gain builder acceptance. Another noted the dehumidification aspect needs to be clearly understood.</p>
