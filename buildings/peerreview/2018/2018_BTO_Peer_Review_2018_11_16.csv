<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach was solid, as it addresses key problems in heat exchanger (HX) manufacturing and can produce incremental improvements in performance by reducing the number of HX joints. Reviewers did identify several potential issues with the approach, however. One reviewer flagged that there was no risk mitigation strategy for the HX design’s split-type joints, while another remarked that further validation was required to demonstrate that the new joint type does not result in higher leakage that offsets the gains of a serpentine design. One reviewer was “suspicious” about the long-term viability of the split-type joints, while another flagged that the project team was not considering internally enhanced tubes, which the reviewer identified as being a significant part of the HVAC industry today. To address some of these issues, reviewers made a number of recommendations, including conducting performance testing earlier in the process to identify potential issues as soon as possible and conducting an analysis of energy savings potential due to reduced leakage versus energy consumption increases due to pressure drop.</p>
<p>Many of the reviewers were unclear on this novel HX design’s potential impact, with one commenting that not all brazing joints have the same risk of leaking, and another flagging that the general serpentine joint may help reduce leakage, but it might also cost more energy as a result of the pressure drop. Two reviewers, highlighted the potentially significant impact of the technology if a prototype is validated, commercialized, and adopted widely.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project had progressed satisfactorily based on the project team’s schedule, though one reviewer noted that the project is somewhat behind in its efforts to optimize fin geometry. The team has partnered with several companies along the entire supply chain, which all reviewers applauded, with one reviewer noting in particular how these strategic collaborations would help with technology development and commercialization.</p>
<p>As the project continues, a majority of reviewers found the remaining project work to be on track, though two reviewers voiced concerns. One reviewer noted in particular that a very significant challenge that remains is scaling up the project’s approach for manufacturability, commenting further that, at this stage, performance and manufacturing issues will pose the highest risk to the project’s success and market adoption. Another reviewer similarly highlighted the potential challenges of transitioning from analysis to prototyping.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally found this project’s use of enhanced surface braze joints to reduce refrigerant leakage to be innovative. One reviewer described that the approach’s focus on improving a specific manufacturing process reduced the project’s scope of effort required to achieve its goal, and minimized the variables that could negatively impact project outcomes. In contrast, however, a different reviewer remarked that the approach was actually unclear based on the Peer Review presentation, describing further that the efforts of the project team and its partners appeared to be totally independent, and that it was not clear how the project’s modeling and experimental efforts would be utilized in the future.</p>
<p>Across the board, reviewers felt that this project had the potential to positively impact the incidence of refrigeration leaks and brazing issues, as well as reduce the quantity of brazing materials used. Reviewers did note, however, that the project team did not quantify an impact on energy savings, and also that the project could potentially cause a large increase in production costs, which would limit adoption and therefore impact.</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on their appraisal of the progress that the project had made. One noted the project’s 6 month delay due to problems with the test apparatus, two others commented that the project had progressed and was on schedule to meet future milestones, and one opined that the Peer Reviewer presentation could have included more precise measure of accomplishments. Reviewers were also split on the remaining project work. Half of the reviewers noted that the project had a very specific project plan that was on schedule, while the other half felt that no details were shared, and that work that would be done in the future was unclear. One reviewer recommended that, as the project moves forward, the project team should consider other technologies for reducing braze materials, including 3D printing as well as polymer and composite materials.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed on the success of the project’s partnerships and collaboration with industry and academia. One reviewer enthusiastically added that a government funded, original equipment manufacturer-led, academia-supported, peer-reviewed project was “the best arrangement for… applied R&D success!”</p> 
<p>Reviewers were most pleased with the project’s potential impacts, particularly it’s potential to reduce leaks and lower manufacturing costs. Another reviewer highlighted the project team’s work with Trane’s Advanced Manufacturing Engineering group—focused on validating and demonstrating the project’s joint strengthening design—as the project’s most significant strength. The most common weakness flagged by reviewers was the Peer Review presentation itself, with reviewers recommending that the project team share information on relevant outcomes and proposed impacts more directly.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers offered mixed reviews of this project’s approach to designing and demonstrating a high-efficiency compressor for small-commercial rooftop units (RTUs) utilizing working fluids with low global warming potential (GWP). Three reviewers commented positively on the new compressor design, its high level of performance compared to existing technologies, and the rigor with which the project team tested the technology. Two reviewers, however, expressed that not enough information was provided for them to substantively evaluate the approach. Most reviewers similarly found the project’s weaknesses difficult to identify based on the data presented, but one reviewer did highlight that in order for the new compressor design to work well and cost-effectively, significant RTU system redesigns would be required.</p>
<p>Most reviewers commented that the project had hit its targets and met its project-specific goals, though one reviewer noted that an efficiency target was not hit for one of the Air-Conditioning & Refrigeration Institute’s standard operating conditions that was tested (i.e. ARI-B). Another reviewer commented that they felt there was insufficient enough information to judge the project’s progress.</p>
<p>Reviewers were unanimous on this project’s potential to achieve significant market impacts, in large part because of the new design’s use of low-GWP fluids and nonflammable, environmentally-safe refrigerants. Two reviewers highlighted the favorable market trends for this technology, predicting that compatible high-efficiency compressors will become valuable as the market moves toward low-GWP fluids, and also pointing to this technology’s potential application in a variety of products. </p>
<p>Reviewers were divided on the project’s collaborations. Two reviewers approved of, and applauded, the project team’s partnership with Carrier, commenting that having an original equipment manufacturer with significant market share on board could provide invaluable information on market forces, manufacturability, supply chain issues, as well as aid with commercialization. In contrast, one reviewer felt like the project team was not transparent about partner relationships, was critical of the fact that coordination with entities outside of Carrier was absent, and even identified the project’s close partnership with Carrier—and the fact that results from this federally-funded project could only be shared with Carrier—as a weakness that might hinder the long-term impact of the technology.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that this project is implementing an innovative and well-thought-out approach for a low-cost, remotely-powered sensor platform, with one reviewer highlighting the strong capability of the platform’s equipment to be adapted to multiple communication protocols, building management systems (BMS), and transducer elements. Most reviewers, however, also pointed out limitations or uncertainties with the technology, including concerns over the power supply, communication distance, integration of multiple sensors within a single zone, and possible line-of-sight interference. One reviewer was also unclear about the backward communications from BMS to the sensors.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the project is likely to meet programmatic goals related to wireless communication, reduced installation cost, and interoperability. However, reviewers disagreed on whether the project will meet its energy savings targets. One reviewer commented that the amount of energy savings from improving the granularity of building environmental (e.g., temperature and humidity) monitoring through additional sensors remains to be proven. Occupant comfort and thermal management might be more impactful applications. Another reviewer was concerned about the payback period limiting adoption and resulting energy savings.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project has progressed very well to-date and looks to be meeting scheduled planned milestones and deliverables. Reviewers also agreed that the project has a good mix of appropriate stakeholders, including BMS providers.</p>
<p>While most reviewers described the remaining work as meaningful, reasonable, and expected to be completed within the envisioned timeframe, one reviewer expressed concern over the short amount of time remaining to complete development of the remaining electronic components as well as to conduct the final testing and validation. Another reviewer noted that the project presentation did not include a commercialization process or plan. Finally, multiple reviewers suggested addressing cybersecurity issues, particularly in regards to vulnerabilities related to communication protocols.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that this project’s approach in eliminating the analog to digital converter (ADC) logic and developing an all-digital wireless sensor to reduce cost is quite innovative. One reviewer particularly appreciated the use of gray code pattern embedded in the common plane, while another reviewer identified the reliance on RFID for identification and positioning as a major strength. Another reviewer, however, was unclear on the power supply approach and expressed concerned about power consumption issues.  Clarification was also requested by one of the reviewers on the digital acquisition system attached to the sensor for wireless temperature measurements.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that this project is likely to contribute to meeting the BTO programmatic goals for low-cost, wireless sensor networks. In terms of programmatic energy savings goals, however, one reviewer remarked that the amount of energy savings realized will ultimately depend on the sensor application or service, while another reviewer commented that the sensors could have a significant energy savings impact if they can be scaled to form a network and connected with advanced control strategies. One reviewer stated that the current cost per unit is already considerably less expensive than existing products on the market, remarking that this platform will be quite competitive and enable BTO’s energy savings goals if the price target can be further reduced to yield a 1-1.5 year payback.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that this project has a strong team, which demonstrates appropriate skills, experience, and range of expertise. One reviewer, however, commented that the project’s industrial engagement seems weak, while another specifically recommended that the project team initiate engagement with building scientists to improve sensor design, implementation, and integration.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers agreed that the research completed to date is on schedule and demonstrates clear progress, including temperature sensor hardware design and software processing, as well as demonstration of the temperature sensor prototype. Most reviewers remarked that remaining project work also appears appropriate and logically planned, although one reviewer had some concerns regarding completion within the performance period of the award due to activities that could cause some delays (e.g., development and testing of the humidity sensor, development of a non-contact reading approach using self-capacitance). One reviewer also observed that the plans and related activities for practical integration and commercialization were not clear. Reviewers offered a number of recommendations for the project team to consider moving forward, including engaging in additional studies on communication distance where obstacles are present, stress-testing the sensor to better understand sensor reliability, conducting measurement accuracy and uncertainty analysis, reducing the size of the sensor to fit into more applications, and taking steps to address cybersecurity concerns.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>One reviewer noted that the project’s approach is sound, highlighting its focus on developing a low-cost, self-powered, multi-sensor platform that can easily be placed on any surface; this reviewer was concerned, however, because cost data and expected payback were not presented. The other reviewer found the information presented on the project’s novel technical improvements and innovation to be unclear. One reviewer identified one of the project’s strengths as its reliance on low-power consuming components and energy harvesting to prolong the operational power lifetime and increase recharge rates.  The other reviewer, however, recommended focusing future work on either (1) new power-supply methods for wireless sensing and processing or (2) new algorithms to balance and utilize energy.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that this project will contribute to BTO’s programmatic energy savings goals. The other reviewer, however, remarked that while synergistic efforts and platforms from this project may lead to great impacts for building environment sensor technologies, the presentation was vague on how the project will achieve some key potential impacts in terms of energy savings, sensor optimization relative to initial design, and interoperability.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that a majority of the project’s expected objectives have been completed. However, one reviewer noted that it is not clear if the team has accounted for issues such a signal blockage or on-board fault detection, and was concerned that there may not be sufficient time to fully test the technology in various environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Reviewers found solid collaboration and coordination across the team, including manufacturing partner to ensure cost and payback are considered.  Both reviewers also recommended that cybersecurity be considered in implementation of testing of the platform.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach to the development of an optical sensor for humidity monitoring and air quality control is well-structured to meet the project’s goal, with one reviewer flagging that the project’s rigorous approach is borrowed from safety-critical applications in the aerospace industry. One reviewer expressed a minor concern that the methodology for simulating long-term sensor operation (i.e. stress testing) could be better defined. Another reviewer inquired as to how the team will estimate the final cost target of less than $10 per unit since it was not included in the presentation.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that if the project team is successful in producing a humidity sensor at the targets specified (i.e. less than 1% drift after 10 years of operation and $10 per unit), then the project will contribute to BTO’s programmatic goals related to building environmental monitoring for energy management. However, multiple reviewers were concerned about the progress to-date and remaining schedule, with one reviewer commenting that the three months planned for field validation seems short, and another reviewer recommending the development of a risk mitigation plan to assist the project team with their schedule.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project team possesses relevant expertise with meaningful collaboration. However, one reviewer commented that the project could benefit from collaboration with the building environmental systems integration community, which is currently lacking.</p>
<p>For future work, one reviewer suggested tailoring performance testing to the humidity sensor requirements for building energy efficiency, while another reviewer encouraged the project team to make sure to address cyber security concerns.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Overall, reviewers regarded this project’s approach as well-articulated and clearly structured. However, all reviewers also either implied or explicitly suggested that the project’s approach should have been more strongly oriented toward building owners and developers instead of utilities, who one reviewer described as not likely being “the most effective partners to scale-up use of innovative procurement strategies.” One reviewer “heard no mention” of coordination efforts with building representatives, whom the reviewer felt was a “crucial” stakeholder group when it came to writing requests for proposals in the commercial sector. Two more reviewers echoed this concern, while one added that the choice of energy utilities as an intermediary “seem[ed] removed from the actual decision makers the team is attempting to influence.” Several reviewers remarked that the project team appeared to have begun realizing this perceived mistargeting of coordination efforts, commenting further that while the project team “should have” pivoted before, time still remained to do so.</p>
<p>Reviewers were comfortable with the project’s progress on tool development, but disagreement among reviewers was evident regarding how impactful these tools were expected to be in the project’s sample applications and proof-of-concept demonstrations. Several reviewers were also skeptical that the project’s outcomes could be scaled up from its test niche to the wider market, recommending that a different approach—one that engaged a wider set of stakeholders—would be necessary to achieve the project’s intended impacts.</p>
<p>Several reviewers left many suggestions for the project team to consider in regards to improving the project’s approach and engagement of the commercial buildings industry. Several reviewers suggested that a more thorough market analysis of the procurement tools’ intended users could improve the project’s outreach efforts and eventual market diffusion. To expand the project’s pool of stakeholders, this same reviewer suggested that the project team forge partnerships with non-utility partners like the Urban Land Institute, American Institute of Architects, U.S. Green Building Council, and other similar groups, all of who “have more direct access to the individuals [in the commercial building community] with responsibility for procurement.”</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Comments made by reviewers about this project were notably more positive and supportive than the scores suggest. Every reviewer made notably supportive remarks about the project’s approach to engaging chambers of commerce, which they collectively described as an innovative way to promote energy conservation measures across different jurisdictions throughout the country. Similarly, reviewers expressed that the project’s impact could be significant, especially for small business owners, and two reviewers commented these efforts could and should be replicated around the country to advance BTO’s larger goals. According to one reviewer, “the potential for self-sustaining replication is very high,” but another reviewer doubted this claim because “there [was]n't more outreach to other chambers.”</p>
<p>Reviewers expressed apparent satisfaction with the project’s progress to date and remaining work, though one reviewer thought the leasing barrier would need to be overcome, while another reviewer wanted to hear more about efforts to reach even more chambers of commerce. As previously mentioned, reviewers commented that the project’s collaborations were a significant project strength, but one remarked that the project’s “door-to-door” approach of engagement might be time consuming, and that utilizing other avenues of engagement (e.g. the National Chamber Program) could be beneficial for securing additional partners. Several reviewers recommended that the team add a dedicated coordinator to oversee the chamber outreach, while another said the project team might consider presenting the program to a network of chambers to broaden outreach efforts.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Nearly every reviewer applauded this project’s approach to attacking a key market barrier that, according to one reviewer, had kept the retail industry from addressing its cost-effective energy conservation opportunities. Several reviewers underscored the importance of leveraging’s RILA leadership, strong and diverse membership, and its reputation to reach the retail industry with energy information. Other reviewers called out the project’s “clear and well-considered management structure” and its strong planning efforts. One reviewer’s remarks stood in stark contrast their peers, however, claiming that the team’s lack of engagement with retail finance professionals had created a “big risk of project failure,” by not providing the right information in a manner those stakeholders need; the reviewer called this omission a “red flag,” and the consequence of “poor planning and execution.”</p>
<p>Despite this one reviewer’s concern, all others did not doubt the potential impact of this project to advance BTO’s energy efficiency goals. One reviewer claimed that the project’s utilization of BTO’s commercial building efforts provided a foundation for success, while another highlighted that the strength of RILA’s systems could significantly reduce the energy use intensity of U.S. retail buildings. Even though reviewers praised RILA’s role and its influence, however, they did not hold all of the project’s other collaboration and coordination efforts in as high a regard. One reviewer was not convinced that the project’s current momentum was organized enough to be sustained into the future. Another reviewer remarked that there was room to engage property owners, developers, and landlords, which the reviewer claimed were a missing element. As described above, a third reviewer questioned the lack of engagement with retail finance professionals. Not every reviewer was unsatisfied with the project’s outreach, however. One reviewer characterized the project’s partners as “unusually strong and diverse,” describing their “impressive combination of financial expertise, advocacy, and business engagement.”</p>
<p>Reviewers did not comment heavily on the project’s progress. One reviewer found the number of the project’s implementation models to be low, at least when compared to the number of stakeholders in RILA, but most reviewers did not have any significant reservations about the project team’s progress or the work remaining. Two reviewers commented that having educated finance professionals in the final stages of this project would be beneficial, though one remarked that “it might be too late” at this current stage. A predominant theme that emerged from the reviewer’s recommendations for improvement centered on institutionalizing the project’s resources, materials, and partnerships to permanently influence and grow the retail market’s energy optimization efforts. One reviewer remarked that creating a specialized industry group, or developing, “succinct, visual case studies based on adopted models” could, become useful testimonials for other businesses to learn from and copy.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers uniformly praised this project’s approach for its clear and novel focus, which one reviewer framed as “a method of impacting owner behavior” that has been a “key, unmet need in the commercial real estate sector that no other research organization is funding.” Several reviewers understood the preliminary nature of this project, calling it an “excellent example of applied, interdisciplinary economic research,” which one reviewer expected would add to the body knowledge that fundamentally “underpins commercial lending.” Several reviewers also expressed that the approach was appropriately refined to avoid scope-creep despite “the daunting scale of the commercial lending industry.” However, one reviewer worried that the team had spent a lot of energy on lenders, at the expense of researching whether building owners would take action based on the lender's scoring.</p>
<p>Despite these assessments, reviewers disagreed somewhat on the magnitude of this project’s potential impact. Most reviewers did not doubt the project’s hypothesis that, if successful, it could contribute new information that could be useful for the commercial real estate market to “effectively internalize energy-related value into the mortgage underwriting process.” As one reviewer pointed out, however, the ultimate impact of this projects rests on whether the information actually influences lenders “to make the investments necessary to reduce energy consumption.”</p>
<p>All reviewers were encouraged by the project’s progress to date, and most expressed confidence in the team’s ability to complete the work ahead. However, one reviewer noted that a not-so-insignificant question remained unanswered: whether or not the team’s pilot metric for energy in commercial/multifamily real estate energy could successfully be linked to commercial mortgage underwriting. A few reviewers implied that the answer to this question could come down to the project team’s collaboration and coordination efforts, even though all reviewers agreed that the current efforts were strong. One reviewer expressed that by extending the current umbrella of stakeholders to include more building owners, the project team could observe if and how they responded to adjusted price signals. Another reviewer recommended about looking at institutions in the European Union and Australia, whom this reviewer felt were more advanced than the U.S. on considering energy performance in commercial lending.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>All reviewers expressed confidence in this project’s approach, but questions lingered about what the ultimate goal was of asset rating, and whether the project was optimally structured to achieve that mission. Specifically, nearly every reviewer suggested that, in their estimation, the project’s progress had reached a crossroads between pursuing further tool development efforts or focusing more on the Asset Score’s market uptake; one reviewer described their understanding that the “core project purpose” was to take the Asset Score to scale in the market. Reviewers uniformly agreed that the Asset Score had emerged as a relatively mature tool after “quite a bit of time,” and that the project was progressing as intended. However, the tension between tool development and diffusion echoed throughout reviewers’ remarks about the project’s remaining work, its choice of partners, the scale of its intended impact, and whether the project was appropriately designed and defined to achieve what appeared to be joint missions.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the Asset Score had already made a significant impact within its pilot niche of “discrete programs and local governments,” wherein “key foundational research” had been undertaken to help the commercial building real estate sector “fully incorporate energy efficiency into [its] core business practices, including appraisal and underwriting.” Reviewers remarked that these efforts align with BTO’s commercial building goal of advancing net-zero buildings by filling long-existing gaps, providing the market with a tool that “effectively addresses a range of technical and design challenges [with] an impressive kit of analytical tools that are logically integrated with other [DOE] programs.” There was more confusion, however, about the future of this project.</p>
<p>If this project was primarily oriented to develop a successful tool, than every reviewer seemed to agree that the project team mostly accomplished their objectives. However, several reviewers were less convinced that the project had made much progress on improving the market adoption of Asset Score. Even though one reviewer described the Asset Score as “a well-known tool,” another reviewer disagreed entirely, saying that “general awareness of Asset Score remains relatively low across the building industry.” Another reviewer wondered how people “would know it exists” and be incentivized to use it.</p>
<p>Consequently, several reviewers questioned the potential scope of this project’s market impact, commenting that much of the project’s remaining work and impact had already been realized if market deployment was not a significant project thrust area. One reviewer surmised that the national impact of Asset Score was “possible, but not inevitable or well documented at this time.” Nearly every reviewer described the project’s collaborations in very supportive terms, but a few expressed concern that the project’s current partners could be pulling the project in too many directions, thereby enabling “scope creep” or causing the project team to overlook other stakeholders who might benefit from the Asset Score.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally focused their recommendations on ways to improve Asset Score’s eventual market acceptance. One reviewer suggested that engaging more cities, utilities, states, the American Institute of Architects, LEED, and other similar partners could improve market diffusion. This reviewer continued by noting that the project team should continue work on the audit template and preview pathways to “increase the number of buildings that ‘get in [Asset Score’s] door.’” This reviewer also suggested integrating the Asset Score into federal practices for building energy audits. Another reviewer remarked that the project team may need to redefine their strategy according to whether they intended to encourage private sector activities that could ultimately produce a similar product that replaces Asset Score, or whether there was a compelling reason to operate Asset Score indefinitely as a publicly managed tool within DOE.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>The two reviewers for this project offered divergent commentary on the project’s approach, progress, collaborations, and remaining work. The first reviewer, for example, was complementary and supportive of the project’s activities, remarking that the project had a clear and logical approach to U.S.-China cooperation and market transformation, and that it was supported by successful and high leverage public-private partnerships—highlighting the project’s impressive ratio of partner investment to public commitment. They described that the project was proceeding as expected, that remaining project work appeared likely to meet expectations and milestones, and that the project featured excellent collaboration between partners in the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>The second reviewer, in contrast, was very critical of the project’s approach to addressing market barriers in China versus market barriers in the U.S. This reviewer commented that the project team was clearly familiar with the China buildings market, but that it appeared as if they had not worked or coordinated with others in BTO to identify the needs of the U.S. market. It also was not clear to this reviewer that the project team had considered how the project’s outputs would fit into the existing U.S. landscape of public and private resources. This reviewer acknowledged that the project had made “adequate” progress, and that plans for future work would likely meet project goals for impact in China. However, this reviewer felt that the project did not appear to be “calibrated” to achieve impact in the U.S.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the first reviewer’s comments were not entirely supportive. They commented, for example, that the project team’s stated metrics for impact measurement lacked clarity, and recommended that the project team do more to establish quantifiable impact measures. They also recommended that the project team better and more clearly articulate the criteria used to prioritize specific activities, as it was not clear why a specific activity was selected over other opportunities. Finally, they recommended collecting more foundational data about the status and trends of the Chinese market, in order to better track conditions and identify points of leverage and opportunity.</p>
<p>The second reviewer also flagged issues with the project beyond the project team’s lack of engagement with the U.S. market. In regards to a specific project activity—the development of a retrofit targeting tool—this reviewer commented that it was not clear what the plan was for deploying the tool. The reviewer also questioned why the tool needed to exist in standalone format, recommending instead that the tool be integrated with other DOE building energy data analysis and simulation tools (e.g. the Commercial Building Asset Score).</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally found this project’s approach to the development of adhesive joints for HVAC&R applications to be very sound, highlighting in particular the project’s team innovative use of adhesive bonding to replace traditional brazing, as well as the team’s use of neutron imaging to verify surface preparation and bonding. One reviewer also called out the project team’s utilization of a test bed facility, which allowed them to test adhesive improvements as they were being developed, thereby promoting an iterative process of improvement throughout the project. Critically, one reviewer raised concerns about potential difficulties using adhesive joints as part of the manufacturing process—though other reviewers felt that manufacturing site visits by the project team addressed this issue—and multiple reviewers voiced concerns about the long-term reliability of joints due to the difference in thermal expansion coefficient between the epoxy and the metals being joined.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project had made good progress and was on target to reach project milestones. The remaining project work was also well reviewed, though one reviewer questioned how the project team would successfully jump from meeting 75% of joint strength requirements to meeting 100% of requirements in just 11 months.</p>
<p>A majority of reviewers agreed that the project will successfully reduce heat exchanger production costs, improve heat exchanger efficiency by reducing leakage, and cause direct and indirect emission savings. One reviewer did express doubts about the scale of the project’s impact, however, citing the concerns noted above about joint long-term reliability, and recommending that a follow-on project be conducted to look specifically at reliability testing.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally approved of the engagement and collaboration with project partners. One reviewer emphasized the benefits of ASHRAE involvement and was buoyed by the interest from braze suppliers and equipment manufacturers. Another recommended formal partnership with a coil manufacturer, however, to ensure that questions about manufacturability are thoroughly and sufficiently considered.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project team’s approach to the development of a cost-effective ground heat exchanger was acceptable. Three reviewers commented on the approach’s potential to drive market transformation through the utilization of natural convection and phase change materials that could break through cost and site restrictions that currently hamper the widespread adoption of ground source heat pumps (GSHP). Several reviewers voiced concerns with the project, however. One reviewer found that putting a large thermal mass (i.e. the PCM) inside of an even larger thermal mass (i.e. the ground) seemed counterintuitive. Another reviewer questioned the performance of the PCM, specifically whether it would provide sufficient recharge and last the life of the GSHP. Two reviewers noted that GSHP installers may be unfamiliar with the new technology—leading to installation and maintenance issues—recommending that the team constrain the installation design, or use both experienced and inexperienced installers to investigate the technology’s sensitivity to installation mistakes. One reviewer highlighted the project team’s strong modeling capabilities and extensive experience with ground heat exchangers, but another flagged that the project was highly dependent on the ability of computational fluid dynamics models to accurately capture physical conditions, which could limit the project’s success.</p>
<p>Overall, most reviewers agreed that, given its early stage, the project was on track and making good progress towards it project-specific goals. One remarked further that all remaining technical challenges appeared solvable, thus keeping the project on track for a timely completion. One reviewer, however, strongly suggested adding a Go/No Go decision after completion of a small-scale field test and preliminary cost assessment. Another expressed that testing a full-scale prototype through both heating and cooling seasons would be beneficial, but did not see this as likely given the project timeline.</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on how well the project was collaborating and coordinating with relevant stakeholders. Half of the reviewers felt that project team had identified a range of partners reflecting a wide area of expertise. The other half, however, noted that many of the identified partners were listed as “potential” partners only, and commented that it was not clear what these potential partners’ involvement with the project would be. One reviewer recommended developing a relationship with one potential partner—NYSERDA—as soon as possible, citing the presence of “inertia” among utility research groups.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that this project’s approach supports the international exchange of scientific findings, and allows for a continuous robust engagement with industry, academic, and public-sector HVAC and refrigeration peers. Most reviewers found that this project directly aligned with BTO’s program goals, in that it allows the U.S. to actively participate on the world stage to achieve energy related goals, and fosters a valuable transfer of technologies and ideas across different international organizations and societies. One reviewer did comment, however, that while this impact is significant, it is difficult to evaluate without appropriate measurements and metrics.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that this project is meeting its project-specific goals in a timely fashion, though one reviewer notes that, given the ongoing nature of this project, it is difficult to comment on progress. Looking forward, reviewers found planned future work to be appropriate and should continue. As previously stated, however, one reviewer found it difficult to comment on the future work of a project without clear milestones.</p> 
<p>Reviewers were impressed with the project team’s inclusion of high-profile community members and its ability to work, learn, and collaborate with the international community. Additionally, all reviewers found the coordination with partners excellent, and representative of a broad range of cooling technologies. Two reviewers specifically called out the partnerships with the International Energy Agencies Technology Collaboration Programme on Heat Pumping Technologies (IEA-HPT), the U.S. National Committee for the International Institute of Refrigeration (USNC/IIR), academia, and manufacturers. Critically, reviewers agreed that the project’s largest issue was its lack of visibility and effective communication to the public, with one reviewer commenting that—as an outsider—it was unclear how to get involved with the high profile groups listed.</p>
<p>Though the project was consistently highly-rated, reviewers none-the-less offered a number of recommendations for the project team. Specifically, reviewers felt that the project team struggled with communicating the success and importance of the project, both to the audience at BTO’s Peer Review and to the public at large. For Peer Review, one reviewer suggested presenting the project in a more visual and interesting way to reflect its significance. Two other reviewers recommended that the project be promoted and advertised better, so that other stakeholders can apply to participate in the project, and so the HVAC field as a whole can benefit from the project’s successes.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were generally pleased with this project’s approach to developing a cooling system that incorporates a liquid desiccant element, finding it to be an innovative thermal storage approach to reducing peak loads by using the liquid desiccant to store dehumidification capacity. Reviewers also applauded the project’s promising method of decoupling latent and sensible loads and regenerating the desiccant with renewable energy. However, while approving of the project’s approach, one reviewer questioned why liquid desiccant systems had not already penetrated the market, and noted that the large space requirements could limit commercialization. Another reviewer also raised questions about whether evaporation of the liquid desiccant could affect the system’s performance and function, as well as about whether evaporated desiccant could pose any health risks for building occupants.</p>
<p>A majority of reviewers agreed that the project’s displacement of high-global warming potential refrigerants, combined with its reduction of peak grid demand by separating latent and sensible loads, would have a significant impact. Two reviewers, however, felt that the project’s impact was not clearly expressed during the Peer Review presentation. According to one of these reviewers, “the claim is that the technology can be used to adjust demand side curves, but those claims seem independent of the liquid desiccant technology, and more closely related to any system that separates latent and sensible loads.”</p>
<p>Most reviewers commented that they found the project to be on track, and that it was progressing at least satisfactorily. Often, however, these remarks were caveated with remarks about how the project was still early stage. One reviewer also questioned whether the time and funding that were allotted to this project were appropriate, noting that evaluation of liquid desiccants—constituting half of this project’s effort—had already been conducted as part of a previous project.</p>
<p>There was no consensus amongst reviewers on the project’s remaining work. Two reviewers expressed their expectation that the project would be completed on schedule, but two others felt that bringing the technology to market within three years would be a challenge. In contrast to the latter two, a third reviewer felt that the project’s timeline—given its funding level—was not aggressive enough. Reviewers also offered a few recommendations for the project moving forward, including that the project team should consider using a hybrid solar-gas approach as a heat source, as this would function regardless of weather and time of day, minimizing the risk of user complaints.</p>
<p>Most reviewers correctly noted that the project team had not yet collaborated or coordinated with any outside stakeholders. One reviewer commented, however, that they found it difficult to evaluate this project’s collaborations, citing the Peer Review presentation’s reference to other product development partners that the project team had engaged with on other research efforts; this reviewer was uncertain about if or how these product development partners were linked to the current project.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the technical approach adopted by this project to develop a low-cost refrigerant sensor—to enable direct and continuous monitoring of refrigerant leakage—was sound. Reviewers highlighted the project team’s use of special manufacturing technologies to develop refrigerant sensors at a reduced cost, and identified the project’s dual pathways for developing a successful solution as a project strength. However, one reviewer expressed that the project team needed to consider product lifetime in their approach, recommending that the lifetime of the sensor should be comparable to the lifetime of the equipment in which it will be installed. Another reviewer highlighted the difficult technical challenge of characterizing power requirements and achieving low-power options for use in an Internet-of-Things environment, recommending a focus on increasing the power-source life of the sensor or offering a wired solution in addition to wireless.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project had a significant potential for impact on multiple fronts, including direct emissions, indirect emissions, cost, and minimizing the leakage of flammable refrigerants. One reviewer recommended, however, that the development of these sensors should occur concurrently with the development of an automatic action for affected equipment (e.g. switching on of an evacuation fan, switching off the equipment, alerting staff, etc.).</p>
<p>Though the project was at an early stage, reviewers generally found that it had progressed satisfactorily, and also that it was on track with the presented schedules and milestones that were presented. Reviewers did not agree on their assessment of the project’s remaining work, however. While half the reviewer’s found the work outlined to be characteristic and appropriate for the project, the other half either could not determine what the specific future work would be or found it insubstantial.</p>
<p>The project team’s collaboration and coordination with partners was generally applauded by the reviewers, though one reviewer expressed that the collaboration appeared to be hastily pursued as an afterthought. A reviewer also recommended that the project team consider collaborating with those stakeholder groups that would be applying the sensors in the real world (e.g. original equipment manufacturers and building systems operators).</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>A majority of reviewers felt this project’s model development approach was appropriate to overcoming the technical hurdles of a well-defined problem. One reviewer specifically noted that the approach of developing a verified and validated model, and then using this model for design optimization, can mitigate potential sorption issues for heat pump water heater technologies.</p>
<p>Reviewers did not agree on the potential impact of the project, nor the value of this impact. Two reviewers stated that the project’s impact would be a reduction of gas and fuel consumption. However, other reviewers either did not have a clear understanding of the project’s potential impact based on the presentation, or expected the impact to be a small, incremental step toward fuel consumption reductions. One reviewer specifically noted that the technology developed could lower costs while reducing the effects of harmful working fluids, but another reviewer expressed concern about the cost of ionic liquid desiccants, and recommended consideration of an alternate, non-ionic liquid desiccant as an intermediate step to achieve market penetration.</p>
<p>Given the early stage of the project, reviewers did not have many comments on the project’s progress, noting only that it appeared to be on track. Reviewers also generally agreed that the future work laid out is appropriate, though one reviewer commented that details of the future work were too vague to adequately evaluate.</p>
<p>Most reviewers found the collaboration between ORNL and the University of Florida appropriate, given the strong modelling backgrounds, but one reviewer noted the project’s lack of qualified manufacturing expertise. One reviewer, however, expressed that the project’s stakeholders were not clearly identified in the presentation, and encouraged the project team to define the stakeholders and expand engagement.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers expressed general concern with this project’s approach, finding it only vaguely described, with two reviewers commenting that the project’s plan and direction were unclear. All reviewers noted that the strongest aspects of the project were its ability of generate electricity and cooling using one source of fuel, while lowering costs and reducing harmful working fluids. One reviewer warned, however, that the approach should not be dependent on fuel cells—as fuel cells only have a 2-3 year stack life—instead recommending a focus on microturbines. One reviewer suggested that the team investigate the effect of the project’s liquid desiccant’s on health and fire risks, as this could be a potential publicity nightmare, while another reviewer stressed the importance of investigating a lower cost liquid desiccant.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers found it difficult to determine the progress of the project based on the Peer Review presentation. Based on the presentation, however, most of the reviewers agreed that the project appeared to be on schedule to meet projects goals. Furthermore, reviewers generally agreed that, if the project were successful, it would have a significant impact in displacing global-warming-potential refrigerants, help flatten the electricity demand curve, and minimize the use of natural gas for power. Two reviewers were hesitant that the project would mature to completion and have an impact, however, noting that the milestones identified in the project are focused on monitoring the dehumidification performance of the system and performing modeling.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that the project’s collaborative efforts were not clear, and two reviewers had trouble identifying the specific role played by ORNL in the project. However, several reviewers applauded the project’s three major partners, as well as the existence of a CRADA.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>All but one reviewer found this project’s approach—supporting technology commercialization through third-party testing of a new product—to be appropriate. One reviewer emphasized the value of objectively testing newer technologies to validate performance claims, though a different reviewer questioned if project this was an appropriate use of government funding, as it could demonstrate bias toward a specific company. A majority of the reviewers remarked that this project could open the market for absorption-based heat pumps by providing data independent of manufacturers’ performance claims, thereby reducing building energy use intensity by accelerating the commercialization and market-availability of high-performance building technologies. One reviewer, however, highlighted that the selected technology still had a number of technical issues requiring cost-effective resolutions prior to performance evaluation for market introduction and impact assessment.</p>
<p>Most reviewers were satisfied with the project’s progress to date, commenting that there was no reason to believe that it was not on track to hit key milestones. One reviewer cautioned that the project was still in an early phase, however, while another expressed confusion about the timeline, acknowledging that this confusion could be a result of typos in the Peer Review presentation. Almost all reviewers found the project’s remaining work—consisting primarily of the actual performance testing—to be appropriate. However, one reviewer did note that performance testing was dependent on receipt of a working prototype, which remained uncertain at the time of the Peer Review.</p>
<p>In terms of the project’s collaboration and coordination with partners, some reviewers found the project’s partnerships to be strategic, serving to efficiently minimize duplicative work. One reviewer, however, commented that project partners were limited to primarily serving as sources of information, and expressed that partners’ practical expertise could have been better applied to the preliminary cost-benefit evaluation for technology down-selection. Reviewers also noted that collaborative and down-selection processes did not allow more than one manufacturer or technology to be selected for validation and benchmarking, which could have helped mitigate the risk of one product underperforming. Two reviewers remarked that the project would benefit from stronger strategic partners and more manufacturers and products per data point.</p>
<p>Most reviewers commented that the key project strength was promoting technology commercialization through independent evaluation of the newly developed gas-fired heat pump technology. As the project moves forward, however, reviewers offered a number of recommendations, including identifying other products to test, harmonizing with U.S. testing standards, engaging with more partners and coordinating the evaluation with them, and working with a certification partner to assess performance, safety, and design deficiencies in selected technologies.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally found this project’s approach to be appropriate for developing an innovative heating and cooling technology that mitigates many of the difficulties with ammonia absorption by removing many moving parts. Three reviewers applauded the project’s creativity in overcoming some implementation difficulties associated with gas-fired heat pumps, while another saw this project as a promising step towards the use of natural gas as a transitional fuel before converting to renewables. Given the project’s thermodynamic complexities, however, one reviewer questioned how challenging it will be to optimize the system to meet efficiency goals. One reviewer highlighted that, while the system’s vessels are hermetically sealed, an ammonia leak still posed a risk, while other reviewers also expressed concern with the use of an extremely toxic working fluid. To address this concern, reviewers suggested investigating another potential working fluid.</p>
<p>Although most of the reviewers noted that this technology could perform with a competitive seasonal COP, two reviewers flagged that its use of ammonia in residential applications would limit its market acceptance. One reviewer described that the project’s impact may also be limited by the use of a secondary loop in applications currently using direct expansion (DX).</p>
<p>Reviewers found strong collaboration with partners, including relevant industry, commercialization, and academic partners. Similarly, reviewers agreed that the project was making good process according to its project milestones, particularly on the breadboard design. Overall, reviewers found the remaining project work to also be on track, thought one reviewer warned that industry partner’s use of a stage gate process while making commercialization determinations may cause a schedule slip.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that this project’s approach of validating energy savings models of direct current (DC) power distribution in buildings and developing new digital controls to manage this distribution is good. Specifically, reviewers noted that the techno-economic analysis will be useful in driving adoption of DC-based technologies by quantifying and validating cost savings. One reviewer, however, commented that it was unclear whether the team has considered the full cost of the technology (i.e. capital costs for installation, operation, and maintenance), which could push the system’s payback period beyond one year (i.e. BTO’s goal). Another reviewer also highlighted that the project’s modeling is based on an all-DC-buildings scenario, which the reviewer described as unlikely in the near term.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that the project scope is limited to mid-sized commercial and residential buildings.  Another reviewer remarked that it could be interesting to first assess the feasibility of DC power in the residential sector before transitioning to commercial buildings. Because there may not be DC alternatives for some commercial applications, one reviewer suggested also modeling hybrid DC/AC applications. One reviewer recommended that the project team conduct more field tests, while another reviewer raised concerns about the reliance on mostly Chinese-based venues for testing because of logistical and other unknown constraints. The same reviewer also recommended that cybersecurity of the system be considered, noting that it was not mentioned in the presentation.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that this project will likely have a significant impact on BTO’s energy savings goals, joining other reviewers in describing the potential impact of maximizing local generation and storage to greatly reduce energy losses from inverters, existing distribution systems, and other sources. Another reviewer remarked that this project should have multiple potential positive impacts on the building industry as long as photovoltaics and other types of DC-based distributed energy resources become more affordable. A reviewer encouraged the team to quantify power quality impact in terms of increased equipment resilience (e.g. fewer failures).</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the project scope is well defined and project work is on-time, even considering the increased complexity of working with researchers overseas. Reviewers commented further on the strong collaboration within the U.S-China project team, highlighting the project’s clear benefits to both countries.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach for developing a low-cost wireless sensor network is sound, with one reviewer referring to the approach as being “right on target” and another describing it as “hit[ting] on all cylinders.” Multiple reviewers also specifically noted the thorough technical approach taken by the team to develop robust system-level cybersecurity for the platform. One reviewer, however, noted that it did not appear that a new framework was being developed, but rather the innovation was in the integration of existing methods and hardware into a single platform.</p>
<p>Reviewers were varied in their assessment of the project’s contribution to BTO’s programmatic energy savings goals due to the enabling nature of the technology being developed. One reviewer remarked that if the project team can keep the sensor cost under $10, then the project will definitely contribute to the 2030 energy savings goals. However, another reviewer noted that the quantitative impacts of this technology were not addressed in terms of energy in the presentation, with another reviewer similarly commenting that energy savings impact will ultimately depend on the application and services the sensor networks are used for.</p>
<p>In terms of BTO’s technical, non-energy savings goals, reviewers noted the interoperability and cybersecurity features being developed may have strong impacts on building management systems and controls. Reviewers commented that the project’s open-source approach may also facilitate commercialization through the integration of other devices and systems.  Furthermore, the scalable design of the platform may result in new findings and changes in practice, including overcoming the technical hurdles to implementing shared-controls for home appliances and grid services.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project benefited from a capable team with good connections and interactions with universities, labs and, industry. One reviewer, however, expressed a lack of clarity about how much the project team had interacted with industry partners in the development of its technology, while another encouraged the project team to explore the possibility of further collaboration with government entities for field testing purposes.</p>
<p>Although multiple reviewers described some risk of possible schedule slippage due to unforeseen events, one concerned reviewer explicitly expressed confidence in the project team’s capabilities to overcome uncertainties and remain on schedule. One reviewer was supportive of the team’s exploration of buildings-to-grid applications and learning-based models, while another reviewer expressed a desire to see more focus on learning-based models and sensor data analytics. Multiple reviewers commented that a commercialization plan should be considered.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that this project’s approach of reducing installed costs is an important step to overcoming the barriers to practical implementation of submetering. More specifically, one reviewer commented that the approach pursued should lead to the development of solutions for all building applications at a minimum installed cost and enable monitoring-based commissioning to optimize building operation. Another reviewer noted the value in creating a dashboard and analytics to verify installation, as well as piloting analytics to ensure requirements on sensing are understood.</p>
<p>On the technical side, one reviewer commended the inclusion of submeter development to measure both AC and DC power, while another reviewer noted the value of the planned integration of the electronics into the current transformer to enable calibration in the lab. It was unclear to this reviewer, however, if similar approaches are being pursued elsewhere. Additional concerns included the level of maturity of the research area, as well as the technical grounding of aspects of the meter development.</p>
<p>One reviewer noted that this project could contribute to BTO’s energy savings goals from automated fault detection and diagnostics enabled by cost-effective submetering. However, multiple reviewers commented that the ultimate impact of project on energy savings is not clear because either energy savings was not quantified or energy savings will ultimately depend on the application. One reviewer encouraged the team to quantify energy savings in order to consider trade-offs between power meter accuracy, energy savings, and installation costs. However, another reviewer felt that installation costs were also poorly quantified.</p>
<p>Many reviewers commented on the good collaboration and engagement with key stakeholders, including hardware, firmware, and software engineering companies, as well as standards bodies (e.g., National Conference on Weights and Measures). One reviewer remarked that more collaboration is needed with industry in order to commercialize the meter, while another recommended working with other organizations to standardize the test procedure and certify the meter accuracy.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the project is on track and has demonstrated significant contributions to the project goals to date. Several reviewers also noted that the project is near completion and likely to meet project specific goals. One reviewer commented, however, that minor execution risks remained, while other reviewers offered a variety of recommendations, including engagement with weights and measures stakeholders, as well as addressing the current absence of an embedded fault-diagnostic algorithm that could identify if and when the meter failed to properly measure loads.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Several reviewers found this project’s approach for validating a BTU meter’s design and data processing algorithm to be technically sound and feasible for overcoming relevant barriers and technical challenges. Reviewers posed a number of questions about the project’s technology, however, including how the meter will operate during a real (versus experimental) measurement, the power requirements, the accuracy required for different use cases, and usability for different fluids as well as steam. One reviewer also would have liked to see more variability between the experimental data set used for training the meter signals and the data set used for validation, while another highlighted the value of testing for edge conditions. Multiple reviewers recommended that future work should address the meter requirements for applicability across a range of pipe thicknesses, materials, and conditions.</p>
<p>Most reviewers expressed that this technology can have a significant impact if the price of the meter is reduced. One reviewer commented that low-cost BTU meters are a key need for energy reporting and optimization, while multiple reviewers specifically noted that the project should help facilitate more effective monitoring and control of HVAC systems in order to meet BTO’s goal of 30% energy savings by 2030.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted that the project’s collaboration is between a small business and a national laboratory, which provides access for the small business to measurement facilities and a platform for transitioning the technology to market. Reviewers agreed that the project was progressing and appeared to be on track, and most reviewers also thought that remaining work seems well-planned to meet project goals. One reviewer observed, however, that a commercialization plan does not yet exist, and another questioned whether future work is sufficiently focused on what is needed to get the technology out of the lab and into the market.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that this project’s approach of leveraging existing nonintrusive submetering to investigate occupant feedback strategies was solid. One reviewer commented that the project’s use of natural language processing to provide automated feedback was novel and potentially transformative. Another reviewer described this project as the first of its kind in type and size, especially in terms of the ability to conduct human-in-the-loop tests of feedback strategies. One reviewer thought that the data generated from this study would be invaluable for further DOE studies. Another reviewer, however, commented that it did not appear that lessons learned from other similar studies are being applied, while another reviewer noted that additional work beyond the project will be needed to mature the technologies.</p>
<p>Several reviewers commented that it was unclear how much energy would be saved by the personalized feedback approach. One reviewer expected that the project will likely have a positive impact on energy savings, but another reviewer e that it was not clear if the targeted disaggregation accuracy will be sufficient to identify loads that may be faulty or ghost loads, thus limiting potential energy savings. One reviewer similarly posed questions about the robustness of the feedback personalization process in terms of false positives or negatives, over stimulation, and over-rides.</p>
<p>One reviewer saw great value in this project’s efforts to better understand effective mechanisms to educate end-users to take action. A second reviewer referred to end-user behavior and education as key factors in addressing energy consumption of plug loads, noting that for these reasons, this project should make significant energy savings impacts in these loads. Two reviewers expressed concern about the project’s social science and human behavior elements, however, noting the project team’s lack of a social scientist.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the project team had strong collaborations, including good coordination between principal investigators. For example, one reviewer pointed out the good collaboration between facility managers, a local utility company, and partner Lucid. Another reviewer noted that the interaction with building residents is very valuable, but questioned the value of the collaborations with Lucid and ConEd. Another reviewer also questioned how the different aspects of the research effort will be integrated to achieve the project goals.</p>
<p>All reviewers commented that the project appears to be on track, and reviewers agreed that remaining work appears to be moving towards achieving project-specific goals. Moving forward, one reviewer recommended exploring some control algorithms based on the dataset to further help correct abnormal energy consumption, and another cautioned the project team about potential participation fatigue.  Finally, several reviewers had questions about the technology’s tech-to-market pathway.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers had mixed reactions to this project’s approach of designing, developing, field testing, and validating a VOLTTRON controller for economic dispatch of building-integrated combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems. One reviewer commented that the approach was well defined and well planned, while another reviewer highlighted that project risk is mitigated by testing the software platform using EnergyPlus. In contrast, one reviewer commented that the one use case modeled by the project team seems an unlikely implementation of the VOLTTRON controller, while another reviewer thought that the risks of field deployment were not well-communicated and that it was unclear if the field testbed has already been arranged. One reviewer acknowledged that VOLTTRON could serve as a nice platform to quickly prototype approaches for CHP plants with economic dispatch problems, but was uncomfortable with the project’s ill-defined scope, unclear on the exact need being addressed, and questioned whether the project is intended to demonstrate that CHP can provide ancillary grid services, existing algorithms for CHP dispatch on real hardware, or that control algorithms can run on commercial computational hardware.</p>
<p>One reviewer remarked positively that the CHP method pursued has significant potential to reduce energy consumption in large commercial and institutional buildings, enabling potential energy savings. Another reviewer similarly noted that total energy savings can be over 25% if the proposed approach is successful, while a third reviewer highlighted the potential grid-services impact. More critically, one reviewer expressed concern over the project team’s calculation of technical potential, remarking that it is not clear what market barriers to CHP the project’s solution seeks to address. Another reviewer also posited that an open-source controller package could have a larger impact in the small and mid-size commercial building space where the controls market is less developed and where in-house control packages with expert assistance are less likely to exist.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers commented that Frontier Energy is a good commercial partner, while one reviewer noted that the project’s academic partners provide complementary technical expertise. One reviewer cautioned, however, that the lack of engagement with other potential commercial partners could reduce the chances of this project progressing out of the lab and having an impact in the field, while another recommended that more stakeholders engagement in the field-testing stage.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed on the project’s progress-to-date, with multiple reviewers highlighting the team’s simulation work as an important step before validation. A few reviewers had no concerns about the project’s remaining work, but others remarked that the project’s field validation efforts should start earlier. One reviewer highlighted that a strength of the project was the software platform’s flexibility to incorporate field data and target particular building types, and recommended that the project team analyze potential energy savings and challenges of the proposed approach by building type. Another recommended that the project team should improve the model forecasting accuracy, especially around load forecasting.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were generally supportive of this project’s approach, with one reviewer noting that it has the potential to reduce residential electricity use while also reducing the effects of intermittent PV electricity generation. Another reviewer considered the approach “understandable” to demonstrate to utilities the magnitude of grid services that homes can provide, but was unsure that demonstrating predictive optimization of residential loads will address major barriers to the deployment of the developed technology. Another reviewer echoed this sentiment, commenting that greater end-user benefits will likely be needed to drive the technology’s adoption.</p>
<p>One reviewer positively commented on the merging of multiple technologies (e.g., advanced controls, cyber security, machine learning interaction) to achieve the desired project outcomes. Another reviewer, however, was unclear about whether the project is developing a battery or whether it is instead developing an energy management controller that provides “battery like” services to the grid. Similarly, one reviewer noted that it was hard to determine what technologies were being developed as part of this project, versus what technologies have been developed previously by the project team.</p>
<p>There was general agreement among reviewers that successfully providing value to both the grid and to end-users (e.g. maximizing energy efficiency) without compromising resident comfort will be an impactful outcome. There was some disagreement, however, about the scale of energy savings that homes will experience. While reviewers generally accepted the forecasted 5% energy savings, one reviewer commented that this number seems “very modest,” while another was not clear on how a ""battery"" produces energy savings or how attributable savings will be accurately measured.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project is progressing on time, and most reviewers agreed that the remaining work is well planned and on track. However, one reviewer commented that a particular project component (i.e. aggregated impact simulations) could be considered a project all on its own, and recommended that down-scoping be considered in order to complete this project on time. All reviewers also agreed that the project team had conducted broad stakeholder engagement, though a few reviewers had questions about the depth of these engagements, and were also unsure about how project responsibilities are distributed. One reviewer commented that the extensive involvement of diverse stakeholders could result in more project benefits (e.g. higher solar penetration).</p>
<p>Moving forward, reviewers offered a number of recommendations to the project team, including that they should consider battery size and payback time for consumers, consider the potential degradation of the assets and home appliances when providing the grid services, and conduct more thorough human-factors testing. Multiple reviewers also noted that this project could potentially be used for resiliency services, and encourage the project team to incorporate resiliency into future efforts.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>While this project’s approach earned high marks, reviewers disagreed on the merits of certain element. Two reviewers described the approach as well-designed, and structured in a way that encourages collaboration to identify and mitigate project challenges. One cited the project’s approach as one of the project’s key strengths, saying that it targets “significant issues that have prevented transactive control strategies to be adopted in residential buildings.” Another reviewer, however, thought the chosen test bed had “significant limitations” with regard to mimicking real-life environments. A second reviewer echoed this criticism, adding that they lacked enough information about the model (e.g. how it behaved across a range of weather conditions, whether their load algorithms were custom-made or adapted from existing literature) to effectively evaluate it.</p>
<p>Most reviewers remarked that the market impact of this project, if successful, could be significant. Several reviewers speculated that this project could produce a “highly attractive opportunity” for consumers and utilities that would accelerate the market adoption of transactive control solutions in residential buildings. However, one reviewer cautioned that the project team had not sufficiently calibrated the project’s value proposition for utilities, commenting that it was not clear how the product’s control strategies “align with different utility challenges across markets,” nor was it clear “what is required for either a third-party or a utility to leverage the system as a resource.”</p>
<p>Nearly every reviewer expressed some degree of concern about the project’s progress to date, particularly in relationship to its remaining work. While one reviewer’s comments suggested comfort and confidence in the project’s pace, the remaining reviewers noted that “significant interoperability challenges remained,” characterizing the project’s customer engagement and control systems across building types and devices as “non-trivial hurdles.” One reviewer added that no quantifiable evaluation results were even available to adequately judge whether or not the project would ultimately achieve its goals. Several reviewers urged the team to “rush” and “hurry up,” cautioning that the project’s experimental field test phase was occurring too close to the project’s end; in their estimation, this did not seem to “leave enough time for implementation errors, data collection and analysis.”</p>
<p>Most reviewers generally made supportive remarks about the project’s collaboration and coordination efforts, while two reviewers offered suggestions for improving the project’s outreach, with the potential to significantly shape the project’s overall impact. One reviewer questioned if the project team was aware of competing technologies that are already on the marketplace, which is a concern that reviewers felt the team’s advisory board should mitigate. Another reviewer suggested that including other stakeholders—aside from manufacturers and utilities who influence state and federal regulations—would be useful because the ultimate application of this technology “will involve utility rate and EE/DR/storage program design regulatory and legislative actions.” A different reviewer went further, calling into question the team’s understanding of utility value streams and drivers. This reviewer surmised that “weak partnerships with end customers” would make it challenging to ascertain how customer value was created, in both new and retrofit residential home markets.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project’s approach was one of the its greatest strengths: clearly defined, thoughtfully crafted, and primed with the right stakeholders to explore interoperability challenges in pursuit of developing supervisory and optimal model predictive control (MPC) strategies. Several reviewers shared their belief that the project’s partners would play a key role in this project’s success, but they also brought up several issues that the project approach had not addressed. First, one reviewer wished for more information about the challenges associated with achieving true machine-to-machine communications for technologies lacking APIs, which the reviewer characterized as a critical technical component for easing consumer adoption in terms of both time and money. Another reviewer identified two challenges that “often limit [the] real-building adoption of control approaches,” and which the project team needed to consider further: first, the unlikely reality that homes are well-instrumented enough to provide enough data input, and second, the variable performance of load forecasting models under different operational conditions that directly affect the control performance of an MPC strategy.</p>
<p>While nearly every reviewer gave the project high marks and praise for the project’s collaborations and coordination—which many considered part and parcel to the project’s success—a few reviewers still wished that the project would engage a more diversified set of stakeholders. One reviewer suggested that the project team should work more with vendors, utilities, and telecommunications providers to better understand how the Home Assistant interface would work with customers. Another reviewer thought the project team should look beyond utilities to other stakeholders who influence legislative decisions, because “the ultimate application of this technology will involve utility rate and EE/DR/storage program design.”</p>
 <p>Several reviewers agreed that this project had targeted a significant market barrier to implementing advanced control strategies in residential buildings, which could be very impactful if successful. One reviewer, however, was concerned that the energy savings goals were too aggressive, and unlikely to be met within the project’s timeframe. Reviewers were in disagreement over the amount of progress the project had made, as well as the fate of the project’s remaining work. One reviewer expressed skepticism that the project team could reach its “lofty” goal of building a platform that “seamlessly facilitates the peer-to-peer information exchange” within the remaining project time, or even at all “given the project’s limited test bed and interoperability challenges.” While another reviewer expressed concern about the numbers of steps remaining, two reviewers were impressed with the project’s progress to date, and one characterized the remaining tasks as “reasonable,” noting that the project team was positioned to accomplish them. Another reviewer concurred, commenting that progress-to-date and stakeholder interactions gave the reviewer confidence in plans for remaining work and the project team’s ability to overcome unforeseen barriers.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project’s approach was sound and well-matched with the project’s objectives. One reviewer, however, did not understand why the project team was using such computationally burdensome resistor-capacitor models to simulate building envelope and HVAC components for an aggregated control problem, which they feared would “slow down the overall solution” and bring the cost-effectiveness of these models into question.</p>
<p>All three reviewers agreed that the project’s outcomes would advance the implementation of transactive controls in residential buildings by addressing market barriers. One reviewer commented that the control approaches could be an attractive way to economically and flexibly tap the time-varying capability of distribute energy resources (DERs), while technologies developed in this project could—if successful—help explore utility pricing and program options for energy efficiency, demand response, storage, and DERs generally. Reviewers expressed equal comfort with the project’s progress-to-date, especially around single-house demonstration and multiple house simulation. Reviewers did not express any concerns with the project’s remaining work, although several did acknowledge that a lot of work remained.</p>
<p>The project’s collaboration and coordination efforts with its stakeholders were well regarded by reviewers, who understood these project elements to be critical to the project’s basic structure and success.

<p>Both reviewers expressed confidence in this project’s approach to enabling utilities and building owners to use flexible building loads as virtual batteries, with one reviewer saying that the framing of building loads as batteries is “useful for both analytic purposes and discussions with other stakeholders.” In this reviewer’s estimation, the approach’s sub-elements were thoughtfully created, necessary, and “tractable.” Given the number of communities nationwide, this project’s outcomes could be truly impactful someday, one reviewer said, while the other reviewer elaborated on this point by saying that virtual batteries could deliver a credible solution for energy storage needs. Both reviewers expressed satisfaction with the project’s progress to date and the team’s plans for its remaining work. The project earned high marks and compliments from both reviewers for its collaborations with various stakeholders, with one reviewer praising the project for its strong involvement of manufacturers and utilities.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers expressed interest in this project’s goals, but not much confidence in the project’s ability to adequately test and account for the full, requisite range of battery attributes (i.e. capacity, reliability, and dispatchability) needed to accurately characterize the components of building systems that could enable buildings to serve as virtual batteries. One reviewer questioned whether a narrower approach focused on a less diverse mix of loads would be useful, since “home [air conditioning (AC)], small commercial HVAC, and supermarket refrigeration seem like sufficiently large and dissimilar loads to each merit separate consideration and technology development.” Another reviewer was not sure how the project planned to identify the virtual batteries’ technical capabilities—their reliability, capacities, and other uncertainties—based on the data researchers were collecting. This same reviewer also questioned if this research was sufficiently novel, alluding to similar research efforts that has been published in existing literature and/or conducted by various national labs.</p>
<p>While one reviewer repeatedly cautioned that the project’s goals were “quite lofty and broad,” reviewers gave high marks for the project’s potential impact, which one reviewer summed up as: more seamlessly integrating buildings and the grid. However, reviewers frequently questioned if the project could deliver results that would ultimately achieve those impacts. One reviewer commented that the AC predictive control modeling approach was “far from completion” and that significant questions remained about whether supermarket refrigeration controls would fall within acceptable food preservation parameters. Another reviewer agreed, remarking that major challenges remained for “all three application areas,” and adding that the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of the project’s building/system models were not discussed.</p>
<p>Regarding the project’s collaboration and coordination efforts, reviewers expressed divergent opinions. One reviewer commented that the project was well-coordinated with other labs and its utility partners, but another reviewer had trouble identifying the stakeholder activities that the project team had undertaken, as well as determining whether or not these activities were core elements of the project. This reviewer commented on two occasions that the project would benefit from more stakeholder involvement in order to clarify future opportunities and validate whether the project’s approach and findings are practical from various perspectives.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Both reviewers were extremely supportive of this project’s approach to designing, developing, and testing scalable technologies for transactive control of buildings, campuses and districts, calling the approach “splendid,” “original,” “foundational” for transactive controls, and executed thoughtfully with with-developed components and objectives. Each reviewer was equally optimistic about the project’s potential impact on BTO’s overall energy savings goals, as well as its goal of demonstrating energy saving technologies. One reviewer remarked further that its benefits “go far beyond the direct project outcomes themselves.” Specifically, the automated fault detection and diagnosis, AIRCx, and auto-correct sub-elements of this project were expected by one reviewer to both advance the project’s ability to deliver energy savings and provide a credible new approach to optimizing distributed energy resources.</p>
<p>Both reviewers were impressed with the project’s progress to date, which one reviewer characterized as “enormous” and “delivering on concept and technology. Both reviewers were equally confident in the project team’s ability to finish its remaining work, especially given the project’s approach, stakeholder engagement, and “spectacular” progress. Each reviewer said that the project’s partners were well-chosen and well-coordinated, and that the team had incorporated new project partners and sub-elements well. One reviewer suggested the addition of a stakeholder that influences utility regulations.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Every reviewer credited this project’s approach both with successfully finding the probable “bottleneck for optimization” of transformers, and with defining its challenges well enough for subsequent work to likely overcome them. One reviewer remarked, “we were always wondering about the transformer performance and limitations, and this project addressed it well.” Reviewers were equally supportive of the project’s potential impact on BTO’s goals. Two reviewers agreed that the project’s goals, if achieved, would significantly improve transformer efficiency and lifetime, with one also highlighting the project’s simultaneous improvement of grid reliability. This would help utilities and transformer manufacturers gain comfort with amorphous transformer longevity, one reviewer said, which would clearly advance BTO’s overarching energy savings goals and its goal of demonstrating energy saving technologies.</p>
<p>Each reviewer was satisfied with the project team’s progress to date, and expressed full confidence in their ability to complete the remaining project work, though one reviewer noted that much work still remained. Reviewers were similarly supportive of the project’s collaborations and coordination efforts, and could not identify any further project weaknesses. Very few recommendations were made, save for one reviewer’s proposal to test the repeatability of the project team’s conclusions with different transformers.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers expressed mixed feelings about this project’s approach to providing objective performance information for windows installed in walls with continuous insulation. The project’s strength was seen as its collaboration and coordination efforts to convene stakeholders from the continuous insulation and windows industries as part of its Advisory Group. Reviewers saw this convening as helping to ensure that the project addressed key questions and mitigated the risks posed by a lack of industry acceptance. However, overreliance on this Advisory Group to disseminate information was mentioned by reviewers as a potential project weakness.</p>
<p>The project’s careful experimental protocols were another strength highlighted by reviewers. However, multiple reviewers expressed concerns over certain technical details of the project. One reviewer was concerned that window installation methods developed by the project team may not have considered the continuity of all critical barriers through a window opening (i.e. thermal, air, water, vapor) nor allowed for drainage from the rough opening. Other reviewers highlighted the lack of interior wall finishes in the setups and the lack of control experiments. Reviewers were also concerned that the use of uninsulated, unfinished stud bays could be used to question the applicability of project outputs, though industry buy-in was referenced as a possible mitigation for this last concern.</p>
<p>Reviewers were mixed regarding this project’s impact. Some reviewers highlighted the project’s significance in settling longstanding questions regarding the subject matter. Others remarked that the project meets Building America’s goal to “research, validate, and facilitate learning…that results in new strategies and practices in residential energy efficiency,” specifically citing the need to reduce risks associated with high R-value enclosures. One reviewer recommended incorporating this project’s findings into guidance documents that could be posted to the Building America Solution Center. Critically, some reviewers questioned whether the results of the project would be sufficiently applicable to a wide range of envelope and window types, given the limited number of window/wall assemblies being examined. Another reviewer commented that they were not sure what the project’s impact would be, explaining that they did not actually know if (or to what extent) current window standards even limited the use of continuous insulation.</p>
<p>Despite the concerns highlighted above, reviewers agreed the project was making good progress and was on target to meet remaining project goals. Two reviewers raised concerns, however, about amount of funds remaining relative to the amount of work that was left to do, and another suggested developing numerical targets to clarify the project’s objectives (e.g. increasing the market share of continuous insulation to X%).</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with this project’s approach to developing an aerosol sealing solution for improved air barriers in new construction. Reviewers also agreed the project could have a significant impact on BTO’s goals to improve home energy savings, with one reviewer commenting that anything that “facilitates air sealing in the hard to reach nooks and crannies is useful,” and another reviewer opining that “this approach can truly be a game changer if proven to be effective and safe.” Regarding this project’s specific technology, however, reviewers expressed some concerns. For example, multiple reviewers commented on the durability of the approach, suggesting that some durability assessment be conducted (e.g. follow-up airtightness tests in homes). One reviewer questioned whether this technology would disincentivize designers or contractors from properly ensuring the continuity of the air barrier, because these actors could get “close enough” airtightness with this sealing technology. Another reviewer recommended emphasizing that aerosol sealing should be a supplementary step in creating airtightness, rather than used in lieu of installing a “proper” air barrier. Multiple reviewers also noted the need for a larger, statistically significant, sample size to counter skeptics’ concerns.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was making good progress, was on track to complete remaining project work, and had done a good job collaborating with stakeholders. One reviewer, however, suggested expanding the number of stakeholders, including builders and field installers/contractors, particularly those specializing in air sealing. Another reviewer expressed doubt about the number of options available for expanded collaboration, in part because the project was testing a proprietary product from a single manufacturer, limiting outreach options.</p>
<p>Reviewers used adjectives such as “disruptive” and “game-changing” when describing the strengths of the project. Other strengths highlighted by reviewers included the technology’s ease of use and the demonstration of immediate results. According to one reviewer, however, the project’s main weaknesses came from holes created in enclosures after the sealing technology has been used, as well as the integration of this technology with other possible air barrier strategies.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers approved of this project’s approach to refining and demonstrating a solid-panel “perfect wall” system. One reviewer expected the demonstration of this system on Habitat for Humanity homes, combined with the unskilled labor used to build these homes, would pay dividends in terms of convincing professional builders of the viability of the approach. Another reviewer commented that the use of modeling for energy analysis—combined with actual construction experience and field monitoring—seemed excellent, and was a strength of the project. Other strengths noted by reviewers were the project team and its leadership, the alignment of project outcomes with existing market platforms (e.g. DOE Zero Energy Ready Home, Minnesota code, etc.), and the project approach’s innovativeness.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that the wall system’s novelty could actually be considered a weakness in terms of builder uptake, but highlighted that the system’s short learning curve could overcome this issue. More critically, a different reviewer pointed out that the sensitivity of a specific system component—the peal-and-stick moisture barrier and its inability to be redone—was also a weakness, and asserted that there may be value in experimenting with other materials. Other reviewers commented on the challenges of assessing either the durability of the system or the scalability of the entire concept, due to its use of cranes and the risks associated with on-site construction quality (e.g. cutting the window hole incorrectly) and logistics issues; reviewers consequently recommended long term durability monitoring. Other weaknesses flagged by reviewers were the project’s reliance on partners’ timelines, a lack of clarity on the types of homes the system is recommended for, and the failure to identify a cost analysis methodology. Other reviewer recommendations included maintaining the focus on production building methods and constructing the wall assemblies in a factory.
<p>According to one reviewer, the project has the potential to contribute significantly to the goals of the Building America program, with its demonstration of an affordable approach to residential construction and its potential to reduce labor costs, materials use, and construction time, all while improving energy performance, moisture-control, and durability. Another reviewer commented that the wall system makes “achieving Passive House-level air tightness targets almost easy[,] and providing robust thermal and moisture managed enclosures almost an afterthought.” Several reviewers were unconvinced about the impact of this project on program goals, citing market uptake as an issue because of increasingly complicated architectural styles and because the wall system necessitates a “fairly major shift” in home construction. In contrast, one reviewer saw significant market interest as one of the project’s strengths. In part due to this disparity, reviewers recommended conducting a more serious market analysis.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project is currently on schedule and making progress to achieve its project goals. However, one reviewer questioned whether all of the research questions—mostly related to durability—would be answered in the time allotted, while another reviewer commented on the limited time remaining to complete many of the tasks.</p>
<p>Most reviewers complimented the collaborative efforts of the project, remarking that a good cross section of the industry was represented through the academic, construction, and design project components. One reviewer also complimented the project team for making adjustments based on feedback from collaborators, and remarked that the direct involvement of the builder community for evaluation was a strength of the project. In direct contrast to the rest, however, one reviewer commented that the “degree of stakeholder engagement is not as high as other projects, and does not seem to be a major focus within the effort.”</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach—providing scientific leadership to ensure high quality, impactful results from Building America’s (BA) building science research program—was good, necessary to enable technology, and essential to ensure continuous operation of the BA program. One reviewer lauded the project for leveraging resources from across the national labs to ensure the best use of previously invested resources and assets. One reviewer commented that the “project is basically the entire [BA] program, which appears to be working well,” while also noting uncertainties about program impacts and questioning program evaluation methodologies. Reviewers suggested comparing the BA program with other market transformation efforts to evaluate the success of this project.</p>
<p>Reviewers had mixed feelings regarding the project’s impact. One reviewer remarked that it is important to remember that this project’s management and support of BA’s research portfolio are keys to the success of the overall BA program. Multiple reviewers, however, expressed that it was difficult to measure this specific project’s impact, as other BA projects that are funded and overseen by this one get the credit for their individual project’s impacts. Despite these difficulties, reviewers agreed the project team had made good progress in achieving its project-specific goals, and had done a good job collaborating with relevant stakeholders. This collaboration with all BA activities overseen by the project team was perceived by reviewers to be key to ensuring that remaining project goals are met.</p>
<p>Reviewers identified a myriad of project strengths, including the project team’s requisite expertise to support each BA research effort, the project’s focus on system performance over component performance, and its focus on market transformation. Project weaknesses were also diverse. One reviewer stated that as an overhead program, there may be a desire to limit involvement, while another reviewer questioned the size of the budget in comparison to the research budgets this project oversees. One reviewer wasn’t sure if the project’s technical expertise was utilized by other BA teams, and recommended that the project team better highlight the technical support it has provided. Other recommendations were to focus the project on in-field performance by making use of Internet of Things and smart meter technologies for data collection, and also to conduct builder interviews to determine what parts of this project this stakeholder groups values most.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers overwhelmingly agreed that this project’s approach to disseminating Building America (BA) research was good. One reviewer commented that “knowledge is power and [the Building America Solution Center (BASC)] is where all of the knowledge resides,” and another described the BASC as a very user-friendly website. Reviewers generally agreed that the project has had a positive impact on BTO’s residential building goals, and that the BASC is key to the BA program’s strategy of getting technology to market. While overwhelmingly praising the availability of such a complete library of knowledge in a single location, some reviewers questioned the project’s impact due to the lack of information on how many users actually implement lessons learned from the BASC. Another area of concern raised by reviewers was the work being done to drive users to the site (e.g. social media marketing).</p>
<p>A majority of reviewers agreed that the project was making good progress, with website traffic continuously building and exponential growth seen as likely. The incorporation of existing building resources and an expansion of user demographics (e.g. architects) were seen as positive indicators of this progress. One reviewer noted, however, that there were no numerical targets for user growth to evaluate against, and that it would require research to see how similar efforts of knowledge dissemination are judged. Reviewers agreed that the project had a clear and reasonable plan for completing its work, although multiple reviewers commented on the need for continuous maintenance of the BASC. One reviewer even mentioned the volume of information available on the BASC—normally a strength—as a potential weakness, given the need to provide ongoing support to the website.</p>
<p>The project was generally seen as having strong collaborations with a wide variety of stakeholders, both public and private, but there was some disagreement regarding the project team’s level coordination with other DOE programs, including other BA research teams. One reviewer highlighted the need for the project team to gain an understanding of the needs of its customers (i.e. those who implement solutions at the design stage and in the field). Teaming with the National Association of Homebuilders was seen by reviewers as a good idea, and reviewers also suggested collaborations with the code enforcement and regulatory community, as these domains have been identified as barriers to technology deployment. Additionally, disaster resistance was mentioned as another new domain that should be included in the BASC. The need for a wider scope in stakeholder outreach was seen as a project weakness, and more marketing was recommended to address the deficit. One reviewer suggested a “sort of Wikipedia interface,” or a campaign within Wikipedia, to drive users to the BASC. Another reviewer suggested ensuring that research from non-DOE organizations (e.g. foreign research and research from other federal agencies) is also included.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed with this project’s approach of holding an annual competition for college teams to design zero energy ready homes. Multiple reviewers complimented the project’s positive influence on developing a future-focused STEM workforce, as well as the project’s efficient, effective, and unique ability to generate interest in building science at the undergraduate level, especially at a time when there was no national building science curriculum. Reviewers also agreed on the project’s positive impact in helping meet BTO’s residential building goals, by helping to develop a better talent pipeline for the building community in a more robust, cheaper, and safer manner than its counterpart, the Solar Decathlon. One reviewer, lamented the lack of an actual house being built at the end of the competition, describing that this possibly left educational opportunities on the table. Multiple reviewers also pointed out the possibility that not enough students will be exposed to Race to Zero to meet the timeline of program goals, but expressed interest in seeing how many student ended up in the high-performance building field. To quote one reviewer: “If this effort could be shown to lead to hiring by homebuilders who previously didn't put much thought into building science, that would be a great story.”</p> 
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project had been making good progress, having conducted several competitions with increasing student participation each year, and having engaged in successful collaborations with both industry partners and educational institutions. One reviewer, however, highlighted a lack of numerical goals against which progress could be measured, and suggested more direct collaboration with builders and contractors rather than just the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
<p>By leveraging increased industry participation and funding, reviewers expected the project to complete its remaining work and continue growing. However, reviewers did express budgetary concerns, notably about the project team’s ability to utilize current funding efficiently enough to reach the desired number of students. Assuming budgets aren’t a concern, one reviewer recommended that the competition add more multifamily and commercial buildings to the competition, as well as existing building retrofits. Another reviewer suggested a slow approach to expanding the competition, so as not to dilute the amount of time students spend with judges and professionals in the field.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Multiple reviewers agreed that this project addresses a major goal of the Building America program: managing moisture risks associated with tight enclosures. All reviewers agreed that the moisture risks of tight enclosures are a key impediment to the adoption of enclosures with high R-values, and commented that the project would have a positive impact on this issue if the project’s goals are met. They agreed that the web-based tool—which provides building professionals with guidance to minimize moisture-related risks in low energy, high performance homes—will be useful for users, disseminating unprecedented amounts of leading building science and expert knowledge in an easily understood manner. One reviewer remarked that the tool could even help show that high performance walls were safer than conventional construction practices. Another reviewer, however, was concerned that the tool may not address a key source of moisture problems in walls: the intersections between assemblies and penetrations.</p>
<p>Reviewers indicated that a significant amount of progress has been made on the project, highlighting in particular the incorporation of user feedback from beta testing as well as the use of detailed experiments for model verification. One reviewer, however, expressed concern about the value of limited hygrothermal lab testing, given the wide range of assemblies that could be conceived by the tool. Another reviewer was concerned about the potential for end users to misuse information (e.g. by skipping important steps in wall construction, such as rigorous quality control air tightness testing). A third reviewer noted that the current task seems larger than originally envisioned—potentially as a result of scope creep—and asserted that this enlargement of scope could compromise the project’s impact by limiting its ability to meet specific Building America goals.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team has done a good job overall with their strategic collaboration and coordination. One reviewer, however, recommended further collaboration with the Master Builder Association, while another reviewer was unclear about the extent of engagement with larger builders and wall component manufacturers and a third reviewer expressed confusion about the level of coordination between the project team and the Building America Solutions Center. 
<p>Looking forward, multiple reviewers agreed that the project was on track to finish on time, though one reviewer mentioned that scope creep would interfere with the timeline. Multiple reviewers also questioned what would happen after the target delivery date of summer 2018, as the tool will need continued updating and improvement, but it was unclear where those resources would come from. Reviewers offered a number of recommendations for the project, including initiating a Phase 2 project to address any issues that remain, conducting further beta testing with master builders in non-traditional markets (e.g. wood-frame multi-unit residential), marketing the tool beyond traditional outlets, and extending the tool to include roof and ceiling assemblies.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that this project’s approach—developing and utilizing physics-based computer models to create the knowledge needed to overcome technical risks in high-performance homes—was a good one. The concurrent incorporation of methods for addressing these risks (e.g. improved moisture modeling, home zoning research, installation quality analysis, and installation quality experiments) was seen by reviewers as a project strength. One reviewer commented that this project would help solve the “chicken and egg problem” of, on one hand, manufacturers not producing equipment for high performance homes because of a perceived lack of market, and, on the other hand, high performance home builders being concerned with the lack of appropriate equipment for their markets. Critically, one reviewer questioned whether Energy Plus was the best mechanism for some of the project’s modeling studies (versus other software like TRNSYS CFD), particularly studies involving zoning.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed this project will have a positive impact on filling the knowledge gap around mechanical system operation in energy efficient buildings, with one reviewer calling the project the only coordinated effort to identify and develop tools and methods for industry use in this area. Another reviewer highlighted that the majority of outputs would be in journal papers, calling this a necessary step to establish scientific fundamentals, but counseled that follow on work would need to be completed to ensure that the building industry implements the research findings. 
<p>Reviewers agreed the project is on track, especially in its development of modeling tools. One reviewer described a significant project hurdle as being the leap from modeling to installation and equipment production, but also acknowledged that the project has and is pursuing development of the necessary information to help solve this issue. Another reviewer expressed some concern about the project’s remaining experimental efforts, given the limited time left, but multiple reviewers remarked that project work appears to be logical to meet project goals.</p> 
<p>Reviewers mostly agreed that the project had done a good job coordinating with national labs like NREL and ORNL, as well as leveraging tools created by other BTO programs. One reviewer identified some collaboration with RESNET and ASHRAE, but pointed out that interactions with these groups did not yet appear to be very significant; project team collaboration with other Building America teams was also questioned. One reviewer mentioned that project team presentations represented the majority of stakeholder involvement, rather than active engagement, and there was universal agreement among reviewers that the lack of industry participation was a weakness of the project.

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers appeared to find the approach taken by this project—to develop a prototype hybrid hot water heater using a proprietary electrochemical compressor—to be at least appropriate. One reviewer highlighted the project team’s efforts to solve problems as they occurred, while another lauded the benefits of this project’s approach for overcoming potential flammability problems and enabling the use of “safe” refrigerants. Critically, one reviewer described the project’s approach as “shotgun” style, which they felt was generally less effective than a more targeted approach. Reviewers also identified weaknesses in certain technical aspects of the project, including the complicated nature of the system being developed and skepticism that the technology could hit its targeted efficiencies.</p>
<p>Reviewers commented that the potential impact of this project was potentially far reaching, both in terms of achieving significant energy savings and assisting in the phase out of harmful working fluids, thereby reducing global warming potential (GWP) emissions. Reviewers noted that, if successful, the project could improve hybrid water heating performances for cooling and dehumidification, as well as contribute to a safe environment by promoting the use of zero GWP working fluids. One reviewer cautioned, however, that the impact would be limited by the type of fluids capable of being pumped while using electrochemical compression, none of which were considered by this reviewer to be good replacements for conventional refrigerants. Other reviewers also questioned the technology’s marketability and large-scale manufacturability.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally approved of the progress being made on this project. Two reviewers were pleased with how the size of the compressor was being substantially reduced, as well as with how the project team was using this technology platform in other applications. One reviewer noted that an extension had been requested, however, while another remarked that it was clear that the project performer was making progress on its product development, but that it was not clear how this progress was being influenced by DOE’s funding.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that the project team had solid partners in industry and academia, who worked well together and could support the technology’s movement toward commercialization once development was complete. Reviewers also found the remaining project work to be promising, on track, and in line with the current project progress. Despite these expectations, however, reviewers still offered a number of recommendations for the project team to consider moving forward, including that they should investigate another working fluid that did not cause embrittlement of the components or long-term leakage (e.g. CO2), and that they should focus on non-technical barriers to market infiltration once temperature lift and efficiency had been achieved.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were split on their evaluation of this project’s approach to developing a proof-of-concept dehumidification system utilizing high-frequency mechanical vibration. For example, two reviewers complimented the project’s innovative use of high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations to mechanically dehumidify moist air, calling it a project strength. One reviewer also highlighted the team’s approach of investigating three structure paths, noting that it would allow for work to continue should one structure experience failure. Two reviewers agreed, however, that while the approach for some elements of the technology (i.e. actuator) were appropriate, investigation into the technology’s capillary action was unfocused, needed to be proven as technically viable, and was a main challenge and a major point of uncertainty for the project. Reviewers also raised some concerns about the mechanical long term stability of the technology, and identified a potential risk of hearing loss to users as a result of the high frequency sound waves.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers found the potential impact of the technology under development to be significant, especially in regards to its ability to increase efficiency without the use of harmful refrigerants. One reviewer noted that if latent load could be removed without cooling and reheating air, this project’s outputs could potentially replace the ubiquitous, inefficient vapor-compression system.</p>
<p>Most reviewers found the project to be progressing well and on schedule, though one reviewer flagged that the project had yet to complete a long-term, usable outcome. Moving forward, however, reviewers disagreed on the project’s future direction. While some commented that the project was likely to hit outlined milestones, two reviewers felt that next steps were unclear, and expressed concern about long-term stability of technology components. To address these issues, reviewers recommended that the project team develop and presents metrics of success for evaluating problematic elements of the technology.</p>
<p>Reviewers found that the project had a strong project team of national lab, industry, and academia experts, all of whom were perceived to have clearly defined roles and frequent communications. To even further strengthen the project’s collaborative efforts, however, one reviewer recommended coordinating with a group whose specific focus was on dehumidification technology.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were supportive of the project’s approach, calling it reasonable, justified, and solid; one reviewer described magnetocaloric refrigeration as one of the most innovative and promising technologies of the future, and wholeheartedly supported efforts to overcome technical challenges to its development. On the technical side, one reviewer highlighted the project’s design that was able to minimize pressure drop—which is one of the biggest losses of energy—while another reviewer commends the project team’s consideration of scaling up to production-type technologies. More critically, one reviewer looked specifically at the use of microchannels for heat transfer, and recommended that the project team instead adjust dwell time in the regenerator to adjust heat transfer effectiveness, and thus the COP. Another reviewer recommended that the approach include thermal inertia as a design consideration to limit cycling losses.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that this technology, if adopted in the market place, would be competitive in efficiency to other vapor compression systems, especially if the project team can hit 20-30% energy reduction while eliminating environmentally damaging working fluids. One reviewer does criticize a claim made by the project team that this technology would add 6,000 new jobs to the U.S. market, commenting that it is doubtful refrigerator demand would grow that significantly. Two other reviewers noted that the cost of materials may be an insurmountable hurdle for successful market adoption.</p>
<p>Most reviewers found the project to be meeting projects goals and be progressing in a timely manner, though one reviewer noted that it was too early to adequately judge the progress. One reviewer flagged that the technology’s COP was still low, but acknowledged that the project team will continue to improve upon this over time. Two reviewers noted that the process being developed will reduce manufacturing costs and will benefit the state of the art in heat exchangers, but generally reviewers recommended a greater focus on system-level issues and providing clarity on the cost of materials.</p>
<p>Regarding the projects collaborations, three reviewers noted the benefits of having a major appliance manufacturer like General Electric (GE) partnered at an early stage. One reviewer commented that manufacturing techniques will allow unique heat exchangers to be optimized around design constraints of unique systems. Another reviewer described their perception that GE’s involvement at this point was limited to overseeing project development and providing industrial and market feedback, but expected that GE would become more involved at later stages of the project. Given the project’s relationship with ORNL, one reviewer suggested utilizing ORNL’s Advanced Manufacturing Demo Facility to consider more sophisticated designs of heat exchangers than those presented.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>All reviewers found this project’s approach viable and innovative in its use of thermoelectric technology to make a heat pump clothes dryer that is cost-competitive with electric resistance dryers and offers a competitive dry cycle time. One reviewer specifically called out the project’s novel approach to taking advantage of the temperature “glide” of air on both sides of the modules to deal with the shortcomings of thermoelectric modules. However, reviewers also expressed major concerns around technical barriers to short dry times, the dryer’s lint tolerance, and the complexities and cost of manufacturing.</p>
<p>A majority of reviewers found that the progress being made was on schedule and in-line with objectives, citing that the technology was within the target drying time range and was meeting Go/No Go criteria for retail price premium. Concerns noted by reviewers regarding progress were the complexity of secondary loops over conventional electric resistance, as well as cost once the technology was commercialized. One reviewer expressed concern that the thermoelectric modules may not be cost-effective enough to be adopted, and multiple reviewers commented that the technology may experience limited market penetration once commercialized due to its price point. Most reviewers agreed that the project team appeared optimistic in its projections for energy savings potential because of this possibility that the technology will have limited market impact.</p>
<p>Many reviewers were pleased with the project’s level of partnership with the clothes dryer manufacturer—Samsung Electronics America Inc.—noting that this collaboration demonstrated the project’s teams intention to move the technology to market. Generally, reviewers highlighted this partnership as a project strength.</p>
<p>Given the potentially small market, one reviewer recommended that dedicated humidifiers were another potential application for this technology, while another reviewer recommended that the team considers using an advanced heat exchanger to further improve the thermal performance and reduce costs. On a larger scale, one reviewer noted that if more stringent energy efficiency standards for dryers were ever promulgated, consumers would be forced to adapt to longer drying times, thus removing that as a concern for R&D teams.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were conflicted about this project’s approach to developing a novel, radiation-based defrosting process for cold climate heat pumps and commercial refrigeration systems. Several reviewers noted the project’s innovative approach to controlling frost, and one highlighted the project’s effort to target treatment on those areas of a heat exchanger with the most frost as a project strength. Two reviewers raised concerns with the project’s approach, however—one commented on the difficulty of getting radiation between the fins of the heat exchanger, which could lead to issues if defrost water runs off to the rear; another reviewer commented that the plan for characterizing the impact of radiation on frost growth was not well thought out.</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on the potential impact of this technology. Three reviewers commented that the technology could have a huge impact on the cost of removing frost—which can cause system inefficiencies and increase energy consumption—potentially removing a perceived barrier to cold climate heat pump adoption. Another reviewer commented that, even if the project’s technology was not commercialized, its characterization of frost growth and defrost patterns would be useful information for the field. One reviewer was less positive, however, remarking that even if project goals were met, this project might not have the expected energy impact. Another reviewer was critical that the project team was not addressing the “penalty"" that comes with the use of radiation, which could also limit the project’s impact.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project was progressing satisfactorily and on schedule, with one reviewer explicitly highlighting that the project was still early stage, and another expressing their expectation that the project’s progress would score higher in one year’s time because of its low technology readiness level. As project work moves forward, however, some reviewers were pleased with its direction, but two reviewers commented that the planned future work required additional thought, while another questioned the acceptability of using microwave radiation. To address these issues, reviewers recommend that the project team develop a more concrete plan to test the influence of radiation on frost growth, and also consider alternative sources of radiation.</p>
<p>Despite the early stage of the project, reviewers were pleased with the project’s collaboration with external partners, with one reviewer applauding the inclusion of academic experts as well as heat exchanger and equipment manufacturers.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that this project’s approach—developing a prototype daylighting roof-mounted concentrator to transmit light into the building interior—could help overcome some market barriers and technical challenges to the achievement of greater reductions in lighting energy demand as a result of daylighting. Unfortunately, reviewers also agreed that while the project team did a good job of identifying potentials risks and challenges to the project’s technology, actual solutions to the risks and challenges were not adequately identified or elucidated. On the technical side, reviewers applauded the project’s innovative daylighting optical design, which avoided the use of fiberglass and could provide considerable cost and performance improvements compared to existing designs, but they critiqued both the technology’s reliance on direct sunlight, which would limit its effectiveness on cloudy days, and the effort that would be required to maintain the system’s internal mechanism and keep it calibrated.</p>
<p>If successful, reviewers expected that the project would contribute to BTO’s program goal of increasing the provision of sunlight to the interior of buildings, and would likely increase daylighting market penetration. However, though one reviewer did note that the project team had met a significant milestone of producing a working prototype, multiple reviewers expressed concerns with the project’s progress, noting the presence of delays in optical molding and the fact that two-thirds of funding had been spent at the project’s half-way point. Given these concerns, two reviewers suggested that the project team accelerate its pace, and recommended that additional resources be considered for the remaining project work. Moving forward, reviewers also recommended the project team consider marketing the project’s technology as a window extension—which would be easier to explain to consumers—and explore ways to integrate the technology into the large existing-buildings market.</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on the project’s collaborative efforts. While one reviewer positively commented that the project team had met with a variety of downstream stakeholders, and had developed the project according to the feedback received, another reviewer was critical of the fact that no up-stream collaboration had occurred to de-risk the research effort.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers found the project’s approach to developing open-cell nanofoam insulation to be appropriate, well formulated, and well-positioned to overcome manufacturing barriers. Most reviewers commented that the team had set themselves up to address technical challenges and mitigate project risks, but one cautioned that the project’s strategy for overcoming its cost barrier relied on a project component—its freeze drying method—which had not yet been demonstrated. On the technical side, reviewers highlighted several project strengths, including the thermal conductivity values being achieved, as well as the technology’s elimination of problematic elements of foam insulation and blowing agents. Reviewers did warn about potential challenges to transitioning the project’s freeze-drying equipment to scale, and they also remarked on the lack of early-stage durability testing and repeatedly noted that the technology’s health and environmental impacts were not clear. Overall, however, reviewers felt that if the project goals are met, the project would likely contribute to BTO’s program goals, as there was high commercial interest in this field and the end product would be low-cost and highly durable.</p>
<p>Generally, reviewers were pleased with the progress the project team had made, particularly highlighting the material development and characterization and the identification of commercialization partners. Reviewers also found the project team to be engaging well with industry partners and scientists, though one reviewer recommended finalizing key partnerships as soon as possible. Moving forward, reviewers found the remaining work to be well planned and achievable, though they did recommend acquiring a freeze-drying partner immediately, and to be flexible with the process to allow for scale-up.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>The reviewers found the project’s approach to the development of thinner, higher-performing insulation materials to be strong, and likely to overcome barriers and technical challenges. One reviewer complemented the vacuum insulated panels (VIPs) as having good targets for thermal performance and cost, but another reviewer cautioned that the performance of the future-looking core-based insulation dropped off significantly with any pressure loss. One reviewer identified this project as a “high risk, high reward” project, and others commented that, if this project were to meet its potential, it would significant contribute to the state of the art. One reviewer warned, however, that market acceptance would be a problem for the technology, which they encouraged the project team to more fully address.</p>
<p>Reviewers found the project to be on target to reach its goals, despite its early stage, and described the project’s future plans as logical and well aligned to reaching the project team’s R80/inch insulation performance target. Reviewers generally felt that the project team’s collaboration with industry, especially NanoPore and Firestone, to be strong, though one reviewer recommended engaging with additional market stakeholders to ensure market adoption.</p>
<p>Reviewers applauded the project’s experienced team and their sound technical approach to the VIP technology, particularly the continued development of modified atmosphere insulation (MAI). However, reviewers found weaknesses in the insulations installation challenges and longevity potential. Another reviewers flagged the sensitivity to pressure for new cores as a potential issue in the future, and recommended an increased focus on barrier development. Other reviewer recommendations included developing greater market connections, direct engagement with installers, and more varied demonstrations to illustrate the technology’s impact.</p>"

<p>Reviewers found this project’s approach to be novel yet ambitious for developing nanoscale insulation with a high R/inch value. Reviewers noted that if the project were successful, it would have a significant impact by providing low-cost durable insulation. However, they also noted significant challenges with the material development, and doubted the feasibility of achieving an R-12 materials for actual applications.</p>
<p>Reviewers were somewhat split on the project’s progress, with several observing the project to be on target for achieving its technical goals—though with some factors like cost yet to be addressed—but one expressing that the project’s technical achievements were modest for a project at its halfway point. Reviewers found the remaining work to be logically planned out, though they noted that there was substantial work left to do. One reviewer reiterated their concern that the R-12 goal was not actually achievable, while another was more concerned about the insulations’ mechanical strength than its R-value. To address some of these issues, reviewers recommend adding more Go/No Go checkpoints to the project plan, and encouraged the project team to more clearly identify and mitigate project risks.</p>
<p>Although reviewers observed that the project team had strong technical qualifications, they found that the project lacked adequate collaboration and expressed concern that industry or manufacturing partners might not want to take on the risk of such an early stage technology.</p>"

Three reviewers specifically and positively called out the project’s efforts to develop new precast insulated concrete walls, with one applauding the project team’s focus on air sealing and thermal bridging in addition to the precast design and weight issues. One reviewer, however, questioned the innovation and value of the project’s data collection efforts around commercial building envelope retrofits.</p>
<p>If implemented in the marketplace, reviewers expected this project to have significant impact on energy savings in both China and the U.S. However, one reviewer expressed that the lack of data and information about the work being conducted in China made it difficult to assess the project’s full potential impact; several reviewers pointed to the project’s lack of an intellectual property (IP) exchange system as a potential culprit for this deficit, encouraging that such an IP exchange system be established as soon as possible. Unanimously, reviewers agreed the project was making impressive progress, surpassing goals to date with quick research and development followed by large-scale trials. Further, reviewers remarked that the remaining project work was focused, on track, and had clear pathways towards completion. One reviewer, however, questioned the significance of China’s contribution to the project. Generally, reviewers were pleased with the level of collaboration with industry in both the U.S. and China, though one reviewer recommended establishing stronger connections with installers and private companies.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that this project’s approach of developing public testing procedures and data sets for evaluating the performance of automated fault detection and diagnostic (AFDD) solutions from both industry and the research community will likely contribute to overcoming relevant adoption barriers and technical challenges for AFDD applications in the buildings sector. One reviewer, however, that this type of benchmarking does not exist after decades of research on FDD. Several reviewers also expressed concerns with the broad nature of the project’s scope. One reviewer recommended that the project team should focus on either creating a test facility for benchmarking commercial AFDD solutions or developing a dataset for AFDD research testing, but not both. Another reviewer was concerned with the ability to provide a uniform comparison amongst products that remain relevant due to continual developments and advancements in products without funding the project in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the team has made great progress, and expect that future work will likely meet project-specific goals. One reviewer, however, expanding the focus beyond chilled water variable air volume systems and a small set of faults. Another reviewer noted that the anticipated project impact is not quantitative in nature and the presentation did not address trade-offs or sub-markets. Multiple reviewers commented positively that this project is creating public datasets that could enable uniform comparisons of various FDD products, but one reviewer questioned whether the resulting data will be similar to the MIT load disaggregation dataset, while another reviewer cautioned that the project team needs to ensure the dataset remains available to the public after project completion.</p>
<p>Most reviewers positively commented on how the national labs are working together without duplicating efforts.  One reviewer felt that the project needs to have other relevant stakeholders and industry experts more heavily involved in the development of the test procedures and benchmarking beyond the technical advisory group. Another reviewer noted that collaborations should be expanded to include large hardware manufacturers. One reviewer commented that Berkley Lab’s FLEXLAB appeared to be a powerful facility for testing AFDD algorithms, but they also wondered if FLEXLAB was the only test site, and whether it covered sufficient breadth of the AFDD problem. Another reviewer was unclear about whether the project team will be providing the benchmarking or if commercial partners will come to the lab to benchmark on the lab’s testing equipment.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>While several reviewers applauded this project’s focus on the underserved small commercial building sector, some reviewers were skeptical of the model-based approach combining DOE’s energy modeling tools with the industry partner General Electric’s (GE) Predix machine learning algorithms for automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD). Two reviewers felt that the presentation did not provide enough information on the approach.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another reviewer positively commented on the potential of minimizing sensor requirements through the approach, reducing a barriers to AFDD adoption in the small commercial buildings sector. The effectiveness of the approach, however, will depend on the accuracy of the energy prediction models, which according to the reviewer is difficult even with a lot of manual and/or high-cost calibration. Another reviewer noted that two faults considered (i.e. duct leakage and excess infiltration) could be difficult to detect with few sensors and/or based only on energy consumption readings because two simultaneous faults might result in no net change in energy consumption.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that this project’s technology solution, if successfully developed, could have a strong impact and contribute to BTO’s energy savings goals. One reviewer remarked that the project is well planned and that current efforts could significantly contribute to the project’s goals, while another reviewer felt that insufficient information on progress was presented.</p>
<p>Looking forward, one reviewer commented that the planned future scope is likely to meet project-specific goals. Another reviewer, however, felt that the proposed future work does not appear to address all gaps and challenges. Reviewers offered a number of recommendations, included applying the AFDD developed to real, operational buildings and revising the faults being considered (e.g., excluding duct leakage and infiltration).</p>

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with this project’s approach to developing adaptive supervisory control for large commercial buildings with the specific goals of developing: (1) control algorithms for optimizing air handing and variable air volume (VAV) equipment, (2) VOLTTRON-compatible open-source controls software, and (3) a high fidelity virtual testbed with baseline control strategies. One reviewer commented that the testbed will be useful for testing control algorithms, but that technical issues remained to get this approach to work reliably (e.g., ensuring that the optimization problem is feasible at every planning instance). Another reviewer also noted that the project has a good approach for successfully reaching its goals, but commented that optimization of equipment operation may be limited to certain variables. A third reviewer recommended that it would be helpful if the project team clearly defined the optimal variables, the number of those variables, and the optimization techniques that will be used to solve the optimization problems. One reviewer remarked that more focus is needed on mapping the accuracy of the models developed and the effect of the learning algorithms, while another reviewer was uncertain of the potential to optimize HVAC equipment other than chilled VAV systems. Finally, another reviewer would have liked see additional details for a thorough review of the approach.</p>
<p>One reviewer noted that the project was well planned, and that current achievements could make a significant contribution to the project’s goals, while multiple reviewers agreed that this project will contribute to BTO’s energy savings goals through advanced controls. One reviewer noted that the project’s overall impact could be high if research results are disseminated to all facility managers and operators for adoption. Multiple reviewers, however, were concerned about the adoption challenges presented by the project team, with one reviewer uncertain as to how these challenges will be addressed, and another reviewer expecting that the project’s sophisticated calculations might prevent quick adoption. One reviewer recommended that more effort be put into addressing adoption barriers, with another opining on the potential need for real building testing.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted the collaboration among multiple national labs on this project. One reviewer also appreciated the involvement of the stakeholder advisory groups. Another reviewer, however, felt that the project needed relevant stakeholders and industry experts to be involved in the development and testing of the proposed model predictive control algorithms as opposed to just participating in the technical advisory group.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Multiple reviewers agreed that the project approach for laboratory validation and field-testing of automated fault detection and diagnostic (AFDD) solutions for packaged rooftop units (RTU) in small commercial buildings is likely to contribute to overcoming relevant barriers and technical challenges. Multiple reviewers agreed that the project will contribute to meeting BTO’s 2030 goal of 30% energy savings from AFDD in advanced and autonomous controls for the commercial sector. Multiple reviewers also noted that this project will facilitate adoption in the underserved small commercial buildings sector, and could enable significant amounts of savings in whole building energy consumption. One reviewer commented that while the project goal was to enable roughly 15% savings in whole building energy consumption, the project team did not confirm those savings in the presentation. Furthermore, the commercialization pathway through the small business partner, JouleSmart, to achieve these savings was unclear for one reviewer.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers commented that the project was well planned and on schedule. One reviewer commented, however, that because there are only three months remaining, they would have liked to see more progress made. Another reviewer expressed that written documentation should include information on how successful the AFDD algorithms are in addition to how they are tested. All reviewers noted that the collaboration between JouleSmart and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is strong, but one reviewer felt that the work distribution by performer was not clearly presented. A few reviewers commented that the remaining project scope appears appropriate and likely to be completed, but one reviewer was unclear on how well documented and universally presented the project’s pseudo-code will be for the community at large. Another reviewer commented that the team should test the proposed algorithms in a larger set of different HVAC system types.</p>
<p>One reviewer highlighted that the project’s focus is on the commercialization of methods previously developed under a separate award, complimenting this arrangement—whereby BTO initially funds early-stage technical solutions and then partners with industry once the solutions have reached some technological maturity and are ready for exploration into commercialization pathways.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with this project’s approach in developing an automated whole-building fault detection and diagnosis (AFDD) tool. One reviewer observed that the project investigated only a small number of building faults, but commented that the scope is sufficient given the amount of DOE funding provided. This reviewer also commented positively on the project’s utilization of undergraduate students as researchers, highlighting the project’s engagement with students from different disciplines, its development of hardware and software tools for educational purposes, and its integration of research into coursework as strengths. Another reviewer similarly remarked that, given the project’s small size, its technical approach is sound. However, this reviewer also commented that the project team spread itself too thin in its scope, and questioned the added value of utilizing VOLTTRON as an execution platform since it is not a commercialized product or industry standard at this time.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments were mixed in regards to project impact. One reviewer commented that the project is likely to contribute to BTO’s goal of achieving 30% energy savings by 2030 from HVAC-based AFDD in the commercial sector. In contrast, however, a different reviewer remarked that the project’s impact on workforce development—a primary objective of the project—was not clear, questioning the exact roles that undergraduates played in the research effort.</p>
<p>One reviewer described the overall progress made as outstanding given the project’s small budget and reliance on undergraduate students. However, another reviewer questioned whether the accuracy and false alarm rate targets achieved are good enough, and was unclear about the next steps for technology development now that the project has been completed.</p>
<p>One reviewer was impressed by the project’s level of collaboration by highlighting the involvement of multiple principle investigators in different geographic locations and the variety of organizations involved.  Another reviewer, however, commented, that the team demonstrated only modest collaboration with the relevant team members.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Overall, reviewers rated the hierarchical and occupancy-responsive strategy pursued in this project for developing and implementing model predictive control (MPC) in buildings highly. One reviewer commented that the approach is likely to contribute to overcoming the barriers and technical challenges for MPC in building applications, and another highlighted the value of developing open-source MPC software for the community at large to test on common benchmarks and platforms. Reviewers, however, raised several specific concerns about the technical details of the approach itself.  These included the use of MPC at room scale, noting the difficulty of predicting load at that level, as well as occupancy prediction, which does not yet have a reliable solution. One reviewer also described several technical weaknesses in the project’s MPC formulation that could create a lot of exceptions requiring operator overtake. One reviewer commented that the project should focus on removing technical barriers in deploying MPC instead of working on a multi-level approach, with another reviewer recommending that the project team clearly define the optimization problem, including constraints and the variables to be optimized, and demonstrate the energy and thermal comfort advantages of using occupancy-responsive MPC over typical MPC.</p>
<p>A few reviewers highlighted the potential benefits of this project, including energy savings, grid integration, and MPC technology adoption acceleration.  One reviewer stated that the project is likely to contribute to BTO’s programmatic energy savings goals, while another reviewer highlighted the global impacts due to the project’s international partnership. All reviewers agreed that the project has excellent collaboration, including industry, ASHRAE committees, and Chinese collaborators.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project had made good progress toward project-specific goals. One reviewer commented on the project’s “impressive"" progress in simulation and experimentation, while another noted the strong buy-in from the community at large that has been engendered by the project’s MPC work. This reviewer, however, also flagged that field testing has been limited to one building and identified scalability of the technology as a concern.</p>
<p>Most reviewers noted that remaining scope is likely to be completed on time, and that the project is likely to meet its goals. One reviewer, however, expressed uncertainty on meeting the technical objectives due to the limited technical information provided in the presentation.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers expressed mixed feelings regarding this project’s approach. One reviewer, for example, noted that the approach may help overcome barriers and technical challenges for effective occupancy sensing and comfort solutions that can be implemented in real buildings. Another reviewer, however, was unsure of the practical applications of the occupancy sensors being utilized, even though they are innovative. Similarly, a third reviewer found the sensor development approach to be sound, but was unsure about other areas (e.g., the use of occupancy prediction as part of the model predictive control (MPC) strategy for buildings. One reviewer commented on the number of existing comfort models available, remarking that the project team should present their justification for further model development, while another reviewer raised concerns about preserving occupant privacy.</p>
<p>One reviewer noted that good occupancy sensors are currently lacking in the market, so this project has real potential for strong impact on intelligent building controls. Another reviewer expressed their expectation that project will meet its 20% energy reduction target via HVAC and lighting scheduling optimization either during experimental or simulation stages. Another reviewer thought that if the project is successful, the higher accuracy sensing and control solutions that are enabled will contribute to BTO’s goals for primary energy savings from occupant-centric sensors and controls. However, this reviewer also noted that accurate counts of people may not specifically have a great impact on energy use, at least compared to traditional methods (e.g., time-of-day scheduling, traditional occupancy sensing, CO2 sensors). On a related note, another reviewer highlighted an apparent lack of focused estimation algorithms that are needed to convert raw signal from the sensors to the number of persons passing through a sensor’s field of vision.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project has demonstrated significant progress to date, and that remaining work appears well-planned and on-schedule. However, one reviewer advised the team to focus on sensor development and its characterization rather than on the MPC development. All of the reviewers also noted good collaboration between the project team and its academic and industry research partners.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers highly rated this project’s approach for developing standardized tools and processes to evaluate performance, specify, and verify advanced building control sequences (i.e. ASHRAE Guideline 36 for HVAC system operations). Several reviewers commented that the approach pursued is likely to contribute to the project’s objective of helping to overcome barriers and technical challenges in the implementation of advanced building controls by reducing the learning curve for their uptake and application. One reviewer cautioned, however, that a large learning curve could still remain as a result of these approaches still being “foreign to the HVAC industry.”</p>
<p>All reviewers stated that this project is likely to have a strong impact, with one reviewer noting that the project addresses an important need of the building controls industry, and another commenting that the project is highly likely to contribute to BTO’s programmatic goal of 30% energy savings by 2030 through more sophisticated and optimized control solutions.</p>
<p>One reviewer highlighted the project team’s strong engagement with the applicable standards bodies (e.g., ASHRAE), while also noting that engagement with potential end-users could be strengthened. Another reviewer recommended additional engagement, if not already planned, with building control manufacturers in the future. Overall, reviewers commented that future work seems well scoped and likely to meet project-specific and programmatic goals.  One reviewer, however, noted that contractors may require training on the tools developed and encouraged the creation of a training program beyond the scope of the current project.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with the approach of adding common distributed energy resources (DER) protocol support to the VOLTTRON platform to assist in enabling utilization for DER management in buildings. One reviewer considered it a sound move to replace VOLTTRON’s existing message bus with one that industry is already comfortable with. One reviewer, however, warned that VOLTTRON might not be the right tool for many of the control applications envisioned, while another reviewer suggested that the project’s advancements should be broadened to platforms outside of just VOLTTRON.</p>
<p>Several reviewers commented that this project should make VOLTTRON more widely used, and multiple reviewers flagged the common bus protocols as an important step for an open-source controls execution platform like VOLTTRON. One reviewer remarked that out-of-the-box support for commonly used DER protocols could allow for DER resources to be integrated with VOLTTRON and leverage all other VOLTTRON services, while another reviewer commented that an open-source, inexpensive building management platform with the right analytics could encourage adoption of behind-the-meter distributed generation, storage, and renewables and support resilience. One reviewer noted that external users are already providing code back to the VOLTTRON community, showing at least modest uptake of the platform, and a few reviewers flagged that the software developer and project partner, Kisensum, for example, has existing projects underway exploring the use VOLTTRON as a DER management platform for large-scale DER deployments.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed in their assessment of the project team’s collaboration efforts. One reviewer commented that collaboration between SLAC and Kisensum was good, but did not observe any activities from NREL. Another reviewer noted that the project team appeared to be collaborating with the appropriate partners in the protocol standards, software development, and grid services fields.  A third reviewer felt that it was not clear how many stakeholders are actively engaged in the project. One reviewer noted that in order to adopt VOLTTRON, hardware manufacturers would need to be engaged, and ideally not just small start-ups.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team had demonstrated significant progress, with one reviewer specifically commenting that adding the project’s protocol adapter layer to the VOLTTRON platform will successfully meet project goals. Multiple reviewers commented, however, that the project team did not describe any plans to provide maintenance and technical support past the project, with one reviewer recommending that documentation should be provided for future users’ use, while another suggested that the project deliverables should be self-sustainable by the users in order to keep up with the evolution of the existing protocols and to maintain the adapter layer. One reviewer suggested that the project team study other open source hardware projects that have come out of the national labs, and come up with a plan to keep the VOLTTRON community sustainable.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were varied in their evaluation of the strengths of this project’s approach of validating the usability of the VOLTTRON platform for distributed energy resource (DER) management systems in buildings through the development of testing tools for use by both research entities and product vendors. One reviewer, however, also cautioned that to be successful, the platform will have to deliver a critical mass of solutions and minimized risks. Another reviewer questioned whether the testing tool kit under development is the “lowest hanging fruit to a minimum viable product” for VOLTTRON, depending on DER developer interest, and asked whether having private companies perform the work using federal funding would instead generate more interest. Reviewers were similarly split on specific elements of the testing kit developed. One reviewer, for example, commended the replacement of the VOLTTRON message bus with one more widely used in industry. Another reviewer, however, was concerned about scalability and adaptation. Specifically, the reviewer remarked that the new debugging tool is rather limited and that adding a specific historian to the VOLTTRON platform might be a barrier to adoption.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project has made significant progress toward its goals and achieving its potential impact. One reviewer, however, commented that final impact will depend on the usability of the debugging tool and historian, while another reviewer thought that it will ultimately hinge on the number of new users. Another reviewer also agreed on the potential impact of improving the VOLTTRON platform, but was unsure about the energy savings impact. Finally, the impact of the VOLTTRON platform itself will depend on whether it “really makes sense for DER applications,” according to another reviewer, who was not sure if this will ultimately be the case.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers rated the team’s collaboration and coordination highly, with multiple reviewers noting that hosting technical advisory meetings that bring stakeholders and potential users together is appropriate for meeting the project objectives. However, many reviewers also recognized the potential risk of potential VOLTTRON users already having their own proprietary development systems in place. As such, one reviewer recommended further discussions with these companies to identify the investment required for them join the VOLTTRON user community.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the remaining project scope is expected to be completed on time and with success. One reviewer remarked that potential users should not be dependent on the project team to adapt the new enhancements, highlighting that good documentation and online help tools should enable potential users to benefit from the project deliverables. Another reviewer, however, expressed concerns about the lack of a plan for future maintenance and technical support of the testing kit.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Each of this project’s three reviewers were strongly supportive of the project’s approach to identifying the source of OLED shorts and preventing them in the future. Reviewers called the research sufficiently “rigorous and scientific” to address the problem of shorts “comprehensively,” and one reviewer expressed that they had little doubt about the project’s ability to eventually “solve the problem of catastrophic damage” in OLEDs. One reviewer agreed that the ultimate impact of understanding the development and evolution of shorts was “extremely important and valuable” to OLED manufacturing, while a second reviewer noted that—in their estimation—the project’s suggestion of adding a Teflon layer to mitigate or even eliminate shorts would likely achieve BTO’s 0.01% panel failure goal.</p>
<p>Every reviewer noted the project’s strong progress, though two remarked that three significant tasks remained to be completed within the project’s final months. None-the-less, all reviewers were encouraged enough by the project’s progress to date that they were confident in the project team’s plans and ability to complete these remaining tasks. Reviewers also credited OLEDWorks with being a strong project collaborator.</p>
<p>One reviewer did caution that it remained to be seen if the developed solutions would continue to mitigate the risk of shorts long-term, while another reviewer expressed that the team would do well to test other solutions, such as partitioning the OLED panel.</p>"

<p>Reviewers agreed that—aided by the project team’s close collaboration and integration with manufacturing partners—the project’s approach of using a low-cost corrugated substrate has helped discover and overcome some of the barriers to mass-producing efficient WOLEDs. By developing an optimized substrate for enhanced WOLEDs, reviewers remarked that this project would likely contribute to BTO’s goal of reducing building energy use intensity by 2030, which one reviewer noted would “obviously” increase the technology’s market penetration and yield significant energy savings. However, another reviewer noted that the magnitude of these efficiency gains were not clear from the presentation.

<p>Reviewers expressed confidence in this project’s approach of using a buffer layer at the corrugated substrate interface to achieve a higher light diffraction efficiency in organic light-emitting diodes (OLED’s), calling it an “excellent idea.” Reviewers credited the project’s concept for making “excellent progress” on achieving BTO’s OLED quantum efficiency goals—the impact of which one reviewer said could “move OLED [technology] one step further.” Every reviewer expressed similar confidence in the project’s progress to date, either by saying that the project was on track, or that it had nearly achieved its primary objective. Reviewers did not comment significantly on the project’s collaboration and coordination efforts aside from acknowledging their existence and adequacy. However, one reviewer claimed to not have heard of any collaborators from the Peer Review presentation. While reviewers seemed all but assured of the project’s progress and future promise, two reviewers noted that the project’s final performance assessment step would determine its eventual impact. Even all reviewers expressed confidence in the team’s ability and plans to accomplish this final task, one reviewer questioned if the selected material’s durability would persist long-term.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team’s approach is sound for meeting its goals of advancing adequate ventilation and improved indoor air quality (IAQ) in high performance homes. They also agreed that it addresses specific needs and gaps that have long challenged industry, including the development of related standards, tools, and other resources. One reviewer remarked that “there is always a concern about allocation of resources” when addressing a “gargantuan issue” like IAQ, and recommended that the project scope be narrowed slightly. But another reviewer mentioned that the project makes sense from an industry standpoint, as the fear of IAQ and ventilation issues is a major barrier to the adoption of more stringent energy codes. The project team was described by reviewers as being very effective at working and interacting with industry, and the team’s collaboration and coordination with industry stakeholders was mentioned as one of the strongest aspects of the project; one reviewer identified the Leading Builders of America (LBA) as the only relevant missing stakeholder group, but they acknowledged that LBA may still be involved via the National Association of Homebuilders. Another reviewer was “very happy” to hear the presenter talk about the project’s connection to public health, and mentioned public health stakeholders as suggested future partners.</p> 
<p>Reviewers by-and-large agreed that the project’s impact is significant, specifically highlighting the minimization of IAQ risks associated with tightening envelopes, the development of RESNET and ASTM standards and updates to existing standards (e.g. RESNET Standard 380 and ASHRAE 62.2), the development of new IAQ metrics and methods (e.g. a range hood test method), education and outreach, an industry-accepted definition of smart ventilation, and the evaluation of existing products. According to one reviewer, RESNET Standard 380 and ASHRAE 62.2 are the most widely used and referenced industry standards, and this reviewer described the project’s influence on these standards as its most important success. Another reviewer commented that the project’s work is critical to moving the industry forward and getting it comfortable with building tighter homes. That said, one reviewer remarked that “work remains on the product development side” (e.g. the development of reliable consumer IAQ monitors), but this reviewer was confident that most project targets would be reached by virtue of the project’s wide stakeholder engagement, as well as “market forces that will rally around and push forward the work started by this project.” One reviewer did caution that RBI’s primary goal is to reduce home energy use by 40%, and that energy savings are a secondary goal of this project due to its focus on IAQ. However, the reviewer also highlighted that the project is critical to removing barriers to the adoption of energy efficient technologies, and that it also addresses other Building America program priorities, including comfort risks in low load homes.</p> 
<p>Reviewers remarked that the project was well planned, has made solid progress toward its goals, and is on track to meet future goals in line with the project timeline. One reviewer specifically highlighted progress made on the project’s test method development, commenting that it “institutionalizes metrics that matter and [will] enable lower energy use and better IAQ.” Another reviewer commented that progress on the effectiveness of the project’s IAQ monitors is encouraging, but that more work needs to be done to produce reliable tools that would allow the baselining of home IAQ. Similarly, another reviewer described that plans for some project elements (e.g. IAQ Score Beta) appeared a little optimistic relative to the project timeline, and counseled that some project efforts may not be completed by the end of the project cycle, while others (e.g. further activity around ASHRAE 62.2) would be an ongoing process.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed with this project’s approach to developing and demonstrating air cleaning materials and air quality sensor applications, as well as building simulation tools to reduce energy and peak loads and improve indoor air quality (IAQ). Curbing the need for outdoor air for ventilation and IAQ purposes was viewed by reviewers as a primary strength of the project, as it would reduce demand for conditioning and filtering the air, especially when outdoor air is unhealthy. One reviewer also highlighted the project’s finding that air cleaning equipment can be made more robust by incorporating volatile organic compound, CO2, and particle sensors to better capture ultrafine particles. Other ancillary benefits of the project that were identified by reviewers were the development of cost effective and reliable IAQ sensors and sorbent technologies.</p>
<p>Reviewers complimented the project on its collaborations with Chinese researchers and other industry partners, and they saw it as a positive sign that one partner intended to manufacture a product from this project.  However, one reviewer expressed a desire to see more engagement with sensor and control manufacturers, such as Johnson Controls, while another questioned China’s role in the project.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was making progress, although multiple reviewers highlighted the IAQ monitoring sensors as an area of concern. One reviewer compared the situation with IAQ sensors to that of CO2 sensors—a multiyear iterative process that just then seemed to be on the road to resolution—and recommended that the project team set realistic goals for IAQ sensor progress. A reviewer also identified the need to quantify energy savings, as well as the project’s focus on new systems versus existing systems, as risks that could hinder the project’s impact on BTO’s 2030 goals for energy savings.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project team should be able to complete its remaining work in line with the project schedule, though they acknowledged that there was still a significant amount of work to be done. One reviewer also recommended that the project team develop a plan for presenting research to end-use customers, utilities, and others to prepare the market for technology introduction.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers described this project’s approach to its research on the deployment and energy impacts of residential Property Assessed Clean Energy (R-PACE) programs as sound, clearly communicated, and possessing both a reasonable scope of work and a clear project plan. The only major criticism of the project approach was offered by one reviewer who strongly questioned why California (CA) was selected as the focus point for the study—rather than a less progressive state whose experience might be more generalizable. Another reviewer, however, noted that the project team had clearly communicated that it was the availability of data in CA that made this project viable.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project contributed to a variety of BTO’s residential buildings goals, including validating the energy performance of building technologies; researching, validating, and facilitating learning and leadership opportunities; and supporting research needed for zero energy buildings. One reviewer noted that these types of program evaluations are necessary to see how much energy has been saved per dollar spent, while another flagged that the California Energy Commission's (CEC) involvement was indicative of the project’s impact, as other states, public utility commissions, and utilities were observing CA’s experience. Critically, however, one reviewer expressed that while data collection and analysis were useful, it was not clear how widely the project would influence the market.</p>
<p>Based on its schedule, reviewers agreed that the project appeared to be on track and had made good progress to date. One reviewer highlighted, however, that while the project had answered its first research question (i.e. whether R-PACE programs are driving deployment of energy efficiency and solar), it would be important for the project team to differentiate and report on the impacts of energy efficiency versus solar. This reviewer also expressed a desire to see longer term studies addressing the overall costs for R-PACE; the consumer experience; and the quantification of non-energy benefits such as increased home value, increased comfort, resiliency, reduced energy costs, and impacts on low-to-moderate income communities. Looking forward, two reviewers warned of the problematic nature of any effort to collect and clean billing data—flagging that unforeseen issues could delay completion of the project—while another reviewer was concerned that there were no milestones listed for during the project’s final 18 months. One reviewer repeatedly encouraged expanding the project team’s analysis outside CA.</p>
<p>Reviewers described excellent CA-based stakeholder involvement in the project, including the CEC and major investor-owned utilities. One reviewer commented on the lack of stakeholder involvement outside of CA, however, while another recommended additional outreach to contractors—whom the project team had described as the primary drivers of adoption—and to the real estate community and consumer protection groups.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that this project’s approach to developing a common, open-source residential energy modeling platform was good. Reviewers agreed that the project, if successful, would have a large impact on BTO’s goal to “research, validate, and facilitate...opportunities that result in new strategies and practices in residential energy efficiency."" Multiple reviewers mentioned the importance of building energy modeling (BEM) to expanding understanding of how different approaches will contribute to high performance housing, as well as to speeding up the research-to-market pipeline. One reviewer further described that ""standardizing simulation engines” to get consistent results—as this project aims to do—has been an issue affecting most efficiency programs that utilize performance modeling. The project was therefore summed up by one reviewer as an “enabling technology needed by new technology developments.”</p> 
<p>Reviewers identified a number of potential hurdles to the project’s success, including the need to gain acceptance of the project’s model by private sector software vendors, as well as to encourage adoption of a common modeling engine by efficiency programs. Reviewers also highlighted the significant effort that is required to maintain modeling tools over time with upgrades and updates. Reviewers identified this need to provide ongoing maintenance as a weakness of the project, and recommended developing a plan for how this continuous support will be provided or to pass it off to the private sector. Reviewers also recommended considering other software (e.g. TRYNSYS) that might be able to provide better modeling predictions than EnergyPlus, as well as continuing to emphasize not just technical enhancements to modeling capabilities, but also the broadening of applicability of tools and analysis in the market.</p>
<p>A majority of reviewers agreed that the project was making good progress in meeting its goals along several different “thrusts,” including ResStock and Home Energy Score/RESNET conversions. Furthermore, all reviewers agreed that the project team would successfully complete the remaining project work, as it was well-defined and closely aligned with both industry needs and BTO’s emerging Grid-interactive Efficient Buildings (GEB) initiative. One reviewer attributed much of the project’s progress to its positive engagements with stakeholders, which the majority of reviewers agreed had been well done. One reviewer, however, was not clear on how much coordination was happening between the project team and other National Labs contributing to the Building America program, or with BTO’s BEM sub-program. Another reviewer questioned why RESNET was not an active partner while HERS software developers were, and noted that the state of California was a good candidate for collaboration. Other recommendations were to further broaden the project’s partnerships to include municipalities, utilities, and affordable housing developers, as well as to target outreach to groups that question the value of energy efficiency and the accuracy of modeling tools. </p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers found the approaches taken by these two complementary Home Energy Score (the Score) projects to be sound. One reviewer described the first project—which was focused on setting up the web-based infrastructure to support home energy scoring—to be a “required” activity if the home energy score was to become an established tool for the home performance industry. This reviewer also commented that the second project—which was attempting to harmonize different scoring approaches by using EnergyPlus as a common simulation engine—could help decrease confusion and provide a more robust approach to developing an energy score. Two other reviewers agreed with these assessments, with one commenting that web-based infrastructure for the Score should improve the accessibility and usability of Home Energy Score platforms, and another affirmed the need for common energy score metrics. One reviewer applauded the project team for considering not just technical approaches to energy scoring, but also issues related to market uptake around financing, consumer motivation, and policy adoption. However, another reviewer warned that if these efforts were successful, they would result in yet another platform for which DOE must provide continuous support, limiting its flexibility to address new areas. One reviewer expressed a desire to see how this work fit with commercial energy scoring applications.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that these projects squarely addressed BTO’s residential buildings goals by validating the energy performance of targeted building technologies and improvements in real-world homes. They also agreed that these projects directly improved the usefulness of information collected by Home Energy Score raters, enabling them to develop implementable and useful real-world measures. Commenting further, reviewers flagged that these projects could (1) result in energy performance metrics that would be used by the real estate and home performance industries, (2) open doors to valuing the impacts of related efficiency programs, and (3) help measure progress towards reducing home energy consumption. One reviewer noted that scoring tools are inherently an enabling technology, but others highlighted that these projects’ tools could have a huge impact on the existing homes market, which represents the vast majority of opportunity for improving energy efficiency in the marketplace.</p>
<p>According to most reviewers, both of these projects appeared to be on track and were making progress towards project goals. One reviewer described that the initial Home Energy Score gateway was operational at the time of the presentation, and that on the modeling side the project team had both completed a good amount of work related to HPXML, and had produced good comparisons of existing tools with EnergyPlus predictions.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the projects featured excellent collaboration and coordination across the country, including with interested jurisdictions, utilities, and national labs. Reviewers remarked that both projects appeared to be coordinating with key players in the home performance industry, which would help ensure that project results would address the needs of end users. The project was also lauded by one reviewer for its work with key EnergyPlus developers as well as a range of Building America teams. Another reviewer, however, flagged the lack of collaboration with RESNET as a key omission.</p>
<p>According to most reviewers, remaining project work was well organized, logical, and tailored to meet the projects’ targets and goals. One reviewer described the remaining project work as “ambitious,” however, referring specifically to the transitioning of residential data to downstream consumer. Another reviewer remarked that a lot of the task seemed to be left to the projects’ final year. Moving forward, reviewers offered a number of recommendations for the project, including that the project team should facilitate access to data generated by the project to help publicize its findings and impacts; make sure that all aspects of the technology are scalable; research ways to lower the cost of producing Scores; and find ways to mitigate the risk of human error during data entry and simplify quality assurance steps.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed with this project’s approach—formulated in response to a City of Seattle mandate around “Building Tune-ups”—of developing a cohort of retro-commissioners, validating their training, and then finding the proper commercial buildings (i.e. 50,000-100,000 sq. ft.) for them to commence assessments. The approach was described as reasonable, and the project was complimented for having a strong set of stakeholders and addressing a critical need for effective retro-commissioning for smaller commercial buildings. One reviewer raised issues with the approach, however, describing it as well defined and appropriate for the project scope, but highlighting that no market assessment or characterization had been completed to identify needs and gaps in Seattle.</p>
<p>Reviewers were not confident about the impact that this project would have on BTO’s commercial buildings goals. One reviewer noted the project’s lack of tool development or building technologies integration—meaning that BTO goals were not directly addressed—but also highlighted the potential benefit for the City of Seattle regarding job training and creation. Multiple reviewers noted the possible monetary impacts of this project, especially for small buildings, and recommended a cost-benefit analysis be conducted to develop viable incentives, as well as possibly partnering with utilities to improve cost/savings tracking. Reviewers also noted a lack of clarity about comparison of the efficacy of virtual assessments to walkthrough assessments, the need to address implementation of energy conservation measures, compliance verification, and the impact of this project on the achievement of BTO’s energy savings targets.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project appeared to be making good progress, though multiple reviewers lamented a lack of project evaluation criteria. On the project’s remaining work, however, reviewers had mixed reactions. One reviewer remarked that the project seemed on track to deliver within its project plan, but multiple reviewers suggested that the project team should ensure assessments are conducted before implementation, and another questioned the efficacy of the project’s structure in enabling actionable policy and program recommendations.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers highlighted that this project uniquely tackled three, separate technologies or “widgets”—an evaporator fan motor, a micro combined heat and power system, and wireless radiator valves—that warranted separate evaluations. Most reviewers described the project’s approach to measurement and verification as “sound,” but half expressed concern about a variety of unaddressed barriers and uncertainties with regard to technology costs, markets, energy performance, and regulatory questions. One reviewer expressed that they could not adequately evaluate any of the technologies, because there was insufficient time during the Peer Review presentation “to focus on any particular project in-depth.”</p>
<p>Most reviewers commented that the project’s portfolio had made great strides, and that remaining project work was on-track for completion. Reviewers were equally supportive of the project’s collaboration and coordination efforts. Reviewers offered mixed remarks, however, on these technologies’ potential impacts on BTO’s goals. One reviewer conjectured that these technologies’ influence would center less on their ability to improve energy performance and more on other non-energy market factors. Several reviewers commented that, of the three technologies, the evaporator fan motor would have the greatest potential impact, while the other two would have more uncertain effects.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach—documenting and improving its ‘one-stop-shop’ model for delivering energy efficiency retrofits for small commercial apartment buildings—was sound, directly addressing the main sources of reduced participation of multi-family properties retrofit programs. One reviewer praised the approach for identifying barriers, technical challenges, and project risks, and for developing strategies to overcome each.</p>
<p>Generally, reviewers were optimistic about the project’s potential to make large contributions towards accelerating energy performance improvements in existing multifamily homes. One reviewer, however, cautioned about the potential scaling challenges associated with the franchise aspect of the project’s service delivery model, adding that it would need strong business management and execution to be successful at a national scale. Reviewers applauded the project’s progress to date, highlighting that it had exceeded its Phase 2 goals during Phase 1. The project’s future work was also generally highly rated by reviewers, and was described as being on track and meeting project goals. One reviewer, however, recommended the project team hire additional staff to manage on-going work. Another reviewer also posed that future work should focus on national presence and sustainable value.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted a number of strengths of the project, including the project team’s engagement with building owners, its integration of service delivery and financing, and its strong group of strategic partners and stakeholders. Another reviewer complemented the project team for pushing utilities to realize the savings of energy efficiency retrofits.</p>
<p>Two reviewers expressed concerns about the post-project franchise scaling, remarking that this effort needs to be well planned, managed, and not reliant on the current project leader. Another reviewer questioned whether the project team was attempting to replicate the model before determining its impacts on communities and building owners. Moving forward, reviewers recommend engaging with other companies and stakeholders to provide additional help, suggesting that this could lead to further outreach. Another reviewer suggested focusing on and understanding regional market needs, as well as rules on development and financing.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project had a strong approach in leveraging existing field validation efforts to develop three technologies. One reviewer noted that the Peer Review presentation itself did not fully answer the scope of the project’s approach, and the reviewer relied on the Q&A portion of the Peer Review session for clarification. Several reviewers noted that the technologies had potential to be “high impact technologies” if they could traverse the “technology valley of death” to broad commercialization, and two reviewers applauded the different technologies’ potential to significantly impact markets. Critically, one reviewer commented that the projects would be more impactful if there was a focus on system efficiency and operations and maintenance, while others highlighted the projects’ limited focus on the cost of ownership and baseline characterization.</p>
<p>Based on project milestones, a majority of the reviewers found the project to be on track and the remaining work to align with project goals. One reviewer expressed concern that dissemination of project findings may not be adequately funded, however, and recommended stronger dissemination efforts to get the technologies into the right markets more quickly. While most reviewers found these demonstration projects to be appropriately partnered, and to be collaborating with appropriate stakeholders, one reviewer suggested further engagement with utilities to facilitate transfer from research and development to market adoption.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers generally found this project’s approach to be sound for addressing tool and data quality challenges associated with evaluation, measurement, and verification (EM&V), although one reviewer noted that the specifics of the approach could have been more clearly presented during the Peer Review. Reviewers felt that this project addressed a critical need for low-cost, high-accuracy M&V—which could advance market models based on distributed energy resources and pay-for-performance—and they unanimously agreed that this project was critical to a broad array of BTO’s goals for commercial buildings. One reviewer cautioned, however, that there were multiple market challenges that would need to be addressed before large-scale market deployment and adoption could be realized.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was progressing according to its intended outcome and milestones, and reviewers also found the project’s future work to be on track to reach its goals, particularly given that the project was nearing its end. One reviewer noted, however, that further progress on the project might be hindered by a lack of clear direction from DOE regarding future M&V initiatives. Another reviewer recommended developing a process to ensure feedback from pilots and testing to inform other related multi-year efforts.</p>
<p>Reviewers commented that the team had identified and collaborated with many key stakeholders, including utilities, public utility commissions, and non-profits. Two reviewers remarked, however, that this project needed to be integrated into a larger strategic systems plan in order to fully transition the technology to commercial applications for national deployment; to accomplish this post-project transition, one reviewer recommended further engagement with energy service companies (ESCO) other and end-user communities.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Generally, reviewers did not find this project’s approach—streamlining measure development so that utilities across the country can use the process to evaluate new technologies for energy efficiency and demand-side management programs—to be effective. Though the project’s concept was deemed strong, and the project’s overall objective was perceived as valuable, reviewers found the project’s approach to be flawed by its inability to capture details about regional markets, utility trends, or customer bases. One reviewer noted that a measure development process can be applicable nationally, but only at a very high level—where there is more commonality between utilities and technologies. Reviewers also described that the project’s lack of funding for technology demonstrations, as well as its lack of stakeholder input, could pose significant barriers.</p>
<p>Given the perceived flaws in project approach, many reviewers did not feel that this project would have significant impact. One reviewer noted that that this project would have significant challenges delivering on its outlined project goals, while another felt that the project’s impact would ultimately depend on the level of detail that could be achieved for a measure development process.</p>
<p>Reviewers did not agree on the project’s progress to date: two reviewers commented that the project appeared to be on track, one reviewer thought the project was behind schedule, and the fourth felt that the project’s deliverables and outcomes had not been articulated with enough clarity for the reviewer to pass judgement. There was also reviewer disagreement about the project’s remaining work. Two reviewers felt the project was on track to complete its remaining work—with one specifically highlighting the potential value of the technology demonstrations—while one felt that the team was not tackling the correct problems, and that remaining project work was not addressing the key challenges impacting utility programs.</p>
<p>Reviewers similarly lacked consensus on the project’s collaborations. Two reviewers noted strong collaboration with various entities and stakeholders, while one reviewer thought the opposite. One remarked that the utilities being engaged were not nationally representative, while another was not clear on how partners’ input or contributions would be incorporated into the project work. As the project moves forward, one reviewer recommended that the project team engage with regulatory bodies to understand market trends to ease adoption.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers overwhelmingly agreed with this project’s approach to the meta-analysis of the costs and benefits of building commissioning in order to update previous studies. Reviewers commented that the project’s efforts to gather current quantitative and qualitative data was likely to have a positive impact on building energy consumption, and will enable better benchmarking for others. At this midway point in the schedule, reviewers remarked that the project appeared to be on track to achieve towards its goals and featured effective and varied collaboration and outreach.</p>
<p>Reviewers praised the project for its ability to gather current data on commissioning projects and the impacts of these projects on facilities.

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers expressed divergent options on this project’s approach and impact. One reviewer positively appraised this projects systems-replacement approach to maximizing energy efficiency, but the other reviewer found the Peer Review presentation to be confusing and commented that the project approach lacked a framework to evaluate technologies according to their costs, benefits, and potential disruption to tenants. This reviewer further remarked that without such a system for evaluating and prioritizing technologies, the results of the project would not be as significant, meaningful, or impactful.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project, despite its early stage, was on target for successful completion, and also that it was being well managed. Reviewers applauded the project’s collaboration and timely project management, but noted that incorporating data generated by the project into the HIT catalyst program—at least in a way that is accurate and actionable—could be a future roadblock. As the project progresses, reviewers recommended ensuring that the outputs of this project are marketable and useable by different stakeholders across the country.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers found this project’s approach was well thought out for demonstrating the energy savings of three system-based (versus ‘widget’-based) commercial building retrofit packages that could be implemented as part of utility incentive programs. Reviewers praised this well-managed project for its ability to provide results demonstrating the potential of integrated design, which one reviewer felt was missing in the market.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was on target to meet its goals, and also that it had significant opportunity for impact. One reviewer noted that the energy savings potentials highlighted by the project team did not meet BTO’s goals for commercial buildings (i.e. 35% whole building reduction), but emphasized the strong potential for deployment of this project’s retrofit solutions if payback was found to be four years or fewer. The other reviewer similarly lauded this project’s development of “good data and hard facts” on the chosen retrofit technologies.</p>
<p>Although reviewers agreed that the project had strong partnerships with progressive utilities and engineering companies, one reviewer suggested collaborating more closely with building owners and facility managers—to test the acceptance of proposed solutions and respond to any concerns—while also devoting more resources to engaging with less forward-thinking utility providers.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that this project’s approach addressed real obstacles to deep retrofit projects in commercial buildings—particularly the issue of tenant disruption—commenting that the project not only aligned with the objectives of BTO’s commercial buildings program, but also would demonstrate the different levels of energy savings that could be achieved through retrofit packages targeting the integration of different building system combinations. Reviewers did identify some weaknesses in the approach, however, including that the proposed test buildings might not be perceived as sufficiently representative of the wider market, and the risk that the program may not achieve wide-scale adoption by utility providers.</p>
<p>When evaluating the project’s progress, one reviewer was content with the project team’s efforts to date to collect data and develop a white paper. The other reviewer expressed concern, however, noting that four tasks had slipped despite being only a few months into the schedule. This reviewer remarked that the remaining project work would be difficult to finish on time, and recommended that DOE request a formal recovery plan from the project team.</p>

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers found this project’s approach to defining the capabilities of existing sensors and connectivity—for the purpose of helping determine if Internet of Things (IoT) lighting is a cost-effective energy saving solution in commercial buildings—to be well thought out, especially its assessment of the current industry, its collection of data from end users and manufacturers, and its efforts to answer all potentially relevant question from IoT adopters. Reviewers agreed that the ability to use lights for more than just illumination, and the development of IoT research roadmaps, will help meet BTO’s commercial buildings goals around whole-building integration. Reviewers also commented that the project appeared to be progressing well, was on schedule to meet all stated goals, and was collaborating with leading stakeholders in all appropriate categories.</p>
<p>Reviewers felt the team was well managed, and featured great stakeholder engagement on this topic, which could have potentially large benefits for the private sector. As the project advances, reviewers recommended that the project team more clearly demonstrate the business case of IoT lighting to vendors, and counselled against defining any limits to what can or should be added to lighting fixtures.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Both reviewers found that this project addressed an underserved area by focusing on the technical challenges of plug load control systems; however, one reviewer questioned whether the approach—conducting a landscaping study to identify the current state of the building automation system, energy management information system, and plug load controls market, and understand ways to better integrate plug load controls into these platforms—set up the project to overcome barriers and mitigate project risks. This reviewer recommended gaining a better understanding of the audience for the project’s study, and how this audience would use the data. Another reviewer noted that the project did not address occupant concerns regarding the control of devices nor relevant cost barriers, and recommended future research should address these issues.</p>
<p>Both reviewers questioned the potential impact of the project, with one noting that tying plug load data to building management systems may not be helpful, and the other commenting that commercial building plug loads were a small, niche segment, so the overall reduction in energy use would be small. None-the-less, reviewers applauded the enthusiasm brought by the project team to this study of an underserved load segment. One reviewer noted how well the project team worked within a tight budget, though both reviewers found that that the project team had not adequately collaborated outside of the national labs and government research agencies.

<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that this project’s analytical and research efforts around net zero energy buildings were prototypically supportive of BTO’s commercial building goals, remarking that it was providing foundational information for future zero net energy projects, and posing the question: “what else could do more?” One reviewer remarked that it was difficult to discern from the Peer Review presentation whether the project was on track to reach its project-specific goals, but both reviewers were none-the-less pleased with the progress being made, especially with regards to K-12 schools. One reviewer described that the next step for net zero energy building was to find a way to reach higher market saturation, recommending that the project focus on accelerators to increase adoption.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers found the project team’s collaboration efforts to be exemplary. One of the reviewers, however, commented on the project’s apparent lack of engagement with commercial owners or major facilities management firms, and recommended greater outreach to these stakeholders to better understand their views on barriers to zero net energy.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>All three of this project’s reviewers expressed confidence in the project team’s approach to the development of red emitting quantum dots (QD) that have sufficient stability on LED chips to withstand the operational and reliability requirements of high-power LEDs. One reviewer called the project’s QD screening and synthesis approaches “novel,” commenting that they directly addressed a key technological challenge with the potential for a high payoff. Despite reviewers’ general collective assessment that the project had accomplished a significant portion of its tasks, however, reviewers unanimously held reservations about the project’s remaining work ahead.</p>
<p>Specifically, reviewers said that several significant technical hurdles still needed to be overcome, notably the QDs’ durability. One reviewer called this hurdle “formidable,” while another remarked that overcoming the obstacle seemed feasible, but also that “time was of the essence.” The third reviewer suggested that a no-cost extension might be needed. One reviewer expressed enough concern that they recommended that the project team halt other elements of the project plan, including its works on green graded alloy QDs and indium phosphide QDs, until more progress could be made on the cadmium sulfide QD durability issue. This reviewer also suggested a few potential remedies to “either optimize the [zinc sulfide] shell or look for other shell materials that might better protect the QD from oxidation.”</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, all three reviewers agreed that this project’s outcomes, if successful, could produce further energy savings down the road and, according to one reviewer, potentially “change the industry.” One reviewer also noted that the project’s impact would align with the BTO’s program performance goals for solid-state lighting, though another remained skeptical about the achievability of the project’s impact, calling the project’s technical goal “hard to reach.”</p>
<p>Reviewers described the project’s collaborative efforts as strong, “rigorously formulated,” and well-coordinated among academics, industry representatives, and the national labs. One reviewer even credited the project’s collaborative efforts with the majority of the project’s success to date.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Two of this project’s reviewers made supportive comments about the project’s approach to building scalable, efficient, modular outdoor luminaires, calling the approach sound and sufficiently comprehensive to optimize LED elements downstream to reduce costs and improve efficiency. These reviewers noted that resulting improvements in the performance of luminaire components would improve the luminaire’s overall performance, and that expected cost reductions could even increase the share of U.S. manufacturers that produce outdoor luminaires. One reviewer continually expressed skepticism about the project team’s ability to achieve its 200 lm/W LED efficacy goal, however, commenting that it could only be achieved through investigations beyond the project’s scope.</p>
<p>Reviewers made positive remarks about the project’s progress to date—particularly the improvement in luminaire efficiency from 74% to 90%, which one reviewer labelled a “significant achievement.” Reviewers were also mostly pleased with the project’s collaboration and coordination efforts, saying that key partners were able to give necessary feedback. One reviewer, however, wished for a partner that would eventually be tasked with manufacturing fixture cores, though a different reviewer described the manufacturing team as “strong.” Two reviewers expressed some concern that Stanford’s part in the project was behind schedule, but the other reviewer disagreed, expressing confidence in the project team’s ability to complete all remaining tasks.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Each of this project’s three reviewers made supportive remarks on the project’s approach to learning more about human-lighting interactions. Reviewers called the approach both sound and scientific, but they did wonder about how the project team was planning to control various confounding variables (e.g. coffee, naps, melanopic lux levels) that could operate independently of the tested lighting conditions to influence hospital workers’ alertness and performance.</p>
<p>Despite this lack of clarity, reviewers still thought that the project explored “a new territory of science,” and that its potential impact could be significant in the medical field. One reviewer also commented that this research would demonstrate the versatility of LED lighting to maximize human performance.</p>
<p>Each reviewer said that the project team’s progress to date was on-track—though qualifying this assessment by noting that the research was still in its early stages—and they expressed no concerns with the project team’s plans for remaining project work. Each reviewer also made supportive remarks about the project’s collaboration and coordination across a uniquely wide array of stakeholders, whom reviewers referred to as a well-coordinated and “excellent cross-functional group,” as well as a highlight of the project.</p>"

<p>All three reviewers described this project’s approach as one of its core strengths, calling it a “well-controlled” experimental design to isolate the effects of LEDs from other variables in “complex environments.” One reviewer said the project had access to the right equipment and was conducting their research in the right environments, but another had some criticisms, commenting that measurements of outdoor illuminance should distinguish between vertical and horizontal illuminance. Another reviewer recommended that the project team should also account for “the emotional-fatigue of the study's participants,” and that the project’s sample size might be a bit small.</p>
<p>One reviewer opined that this project would have “a considerable” impact on the design and use of roadway lighting systems, a contention that other reviewers echoed. Another reviewer remarked further that the project’s results would add knowledge to “a currently open question.” One reviewer expressed their preference for a less general description of the project’s goals, however, describing that this would enable them to make clearer a judgement on the project’s eventual impact.</p>
<p>Reviewers were satisfied with the project’s progress to date, as well as with the team’s plans for completing its remaining tasks. Each reviewer was also supportive of the project’s collaborations, though one reviewer did note that—given the current disagreement between the American Medical Association and the lighting industry—“it would have been nice to have some health professionals or institutions involved to reduce any skepticism that might result from the study.”</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed with this project’s approach to enabling local-government energy efficiency programs by modifying and enhancing open-source tools to perform large-scale building energy modeling analysis on commercial buildings. Multiple reviewers highlighted that this project’s open-source BayREN Integrated Commercial Retrofits (BRICR) tool leveraged existing DOE tools to allow the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and other entities to identify energy efficiency potential of a hard-to-reach sector—small and medium businesses (SMBs)—and deliver technical assistance at reduced cost and potentially large scale. One reviewer commented that the BRICR tool was focused on a reasonable number of use cases, while another remarked that the project appeared to have a well thought out approach for mass assessment and recruitment of program participants. One reviewer, however, was very critical that the approach did not appear to have a well thought out solution for workflow management, which this reviewer believed would be crucial if ABAG wanted to effectively integrate data on program assessments, recruitment, project scope development, and monitoring and verification activities.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed on the project’s potential impact. One reviewer noted that if the BRICR tool was successful in identifying the energy efficiency potential in region-wide SMBs, this could add up to significant regional savings in a sector that was not widely served by efficiency service providers. Another reviewer flagged that the project had already modeled 17,000 buildings in the Bay Area, and that simulation results from 29 energy conservation measures applied to 1,699 SMBs found preliminary energy savings potentials of up to 25%. Conversely, while a third reviewer highlighted that this project was focused on the building stock in California but could be replicated across the country, another questioned whether the project would be replicable or scalable given its lack of a workflow manager. One reviewer also questioned whether the project team’s effort would translate into actual energy savings, noting that immediate project impact was reliant on building owners taking action based on recommendations, and that long-term impact was dependent on the project successfully convincing other cities to mimic the approach.</p>
<p>Outside of an unexpected staffing issue that resulted in a 6-month project delay—which some reviewers were critical of—assessments of this project’s progress were generally positive. Taking into account the project’s revised schedule, for example, one reviewer remarked that the project was on target and on budget, while another expressed that the project was well on its way to delivering the required tool functionality. One reviewer similarly commented that the project appeared to be progressing as expected and was resourced sufficiently to meet the “minimum requirements” of remaining deliverables, while another described the planned future work as logical and building on past phases to expand functionality. One reviewer warned that it appeared as if only half of the software development was complete, and also that a significant portion of work remained in setting up the analysis infrastructure and completing the analysis. However, and in contrast, a different reviewer observed that BRICR development had made significant process, that the buildings for retrofit had been identified, and that—with its 6-month extension—the project had significant time to complete its work.</p>
<p>Reviewers positively observed the project’s “impressive” list of collaborators representing government stakeholders, financial and risk management institutions, and others. One reviewer was also encouraged by the inter-national lab cooperation that was present, though a different reviewer was confused about the specific roles played by—and the level of engagement of—service providers and contractors that were engaged in the project as partners.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed with this project’s approach to developing a software tool capable of modeling dynamic heat and moisture transfer in building envelopes, calling the approach strong, well thought out and detailed, and highly likely to contribute to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. One reviewer also highlighted that, if successfully executed, the approach would provide combined moisture and temperature envelope analysis tools to a large community of users. Conversely, while one reviewer commented that this project would provide a service that was greatly needed for analyses of the residential building stock, another remarked that it was not clear whether the building science community had a critical need for this type of tool. One reviewer was also critical of the fact that the completed software would not be fully released as an open-source product.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project was making good progress, with one reviewer specifically highlighting the significant progress being made in certain key project areas: developing a data input model, integrating the heat transfer and moisture transport models, and completing initial validation of results. Reviewers also agreed that the project’s progress was expected to continue, remarking that the project appeared to have a well thought out plan for executing on the remaining project work, and that remaining tasks had been allocated an appropriate amount of time to complete. One reviewer did express concern, however, that certain milestones had not been met on schedule, while another warned that the tasks remaining happened to be where many issues could reveal themselves, potentially affecting budget and/or deliverable dates.</p>
<p>Reviewers lauded the project’s collaboration and coordination with a broad range of partners, subcontractors, and collaborators, describing the project team as being “well positioned to leverage input and information from these stakeholders to ensure the project remain[ed] on track for deliverables.” One reviewer commented that the project team had demonstrated significant strategic coordination with relevant stakeholders, while other reviewers specifically highlighted the project’s collaboration with several industry entities, its technical advisory group, and ASHRAE.</p>
<p>On this project’s potential impact, reviewer assessments were somewhat mixed. Several reviewers highlighted that successful completion of the project would improve the capabilities of design professionals to analyze the effects of improved approaches to energy-efficient building envelope and assembly construction, specifically by allowing them to conduct more moisture transfer analyses. However, one reviewer pointed out that project would not actually contribute to DOE’s energy saving goals, and another noted that it would be difficult to quantify the non-energy benefits (e.g., health, safety and indoor environmental quality) of improved building envelopes. Several reviewers flagged that THERM—the base tool that this project sought to enhance—already had a user base of over 25,000, but one reviewer expressed concern that further uptake of this project’s tool might be slow, citing confounding market conditions like the decreasing costs of PV as well as tendencies to ignore load reductions before making other building improvements.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers overwhelmingly agreed with this project’s approach to developing holistic modeling and optimization software for data center cooling systems. Reviewers called the approach “impressive” and “innovative,” commenting that—if successful—the project would provide value to DOE in several related areas of interest, including (1) establishing strong use cases to encourage the adoption of analysis workflows based on DOE’s Spawn-of-EnergyPlus tool and (2) providing real world demonstration of the use of Modelica Building Library-based frameworks to solve vexing energy analysis problems.</p>
<p>Reviewers also strongly agreed on the project’s impact, noting the project’s potential to significantly reduce energy consumption for data center cooling. Other reviewers commented that this project would positively impact progress towards DOE's energy intensity goals, particularly because the project targeted a quickly growing market that was responsible for an “outsized amount of energy relative to their building size.” One reviewer called the project “one of the few…that [could] demonstrate measurable energy savings impact,” while another highlighted that the inclusion of a strong commercial technology partner increased the likelihood that research results would be commercialized.</p>
<p>On the topic of partners, reviewers commented that the project team had demonstrated excellent strategic collaboration and coordination with relevant stakeholders, and that this collaboration was well organized and highly effective. One reviewer remarked that the project had assembled a strong Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to help refine project scope and review project progress, describing the TAG’s membership as cutting across several key disciplines. Another reviewer described this project as an outstanding example of technology transfer from academic researchers and national labs to industry.</p>
<p>Reviewers described the project’s progress to-date as “outstanding.” One reviewer commented that project had demonstrated excellent contributions to project-specific goals, while another highlighted that the project team had already completed all the model development work along with implementation and testing in two different data centers. One reviewer remarked that, moving forward, the project also appeared well positioned for the next phase of the work plan. Another reviewer similarly described the project as being well managed from both technical and operational performance perspectives, expressing confidence that the project team would be able to deliver the remaining project milestones and deliverables both on time and on budget.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers were generally supportive of this project’s approach to eventually producing a performance benchmark for ASHRAE’s Standard 140. Reviewers disagreed, however, on whether BTO’s efforts to increase the accuracy of (and thereby confidence in) BEM results was a necessary endeavor to undertake. While one reviewer mused that it was “unlikely that any single private sector entity would have engaged in the design, construction and commissioning of the test facilities that were required to execute this project,” another questioned whether the industry at-large was indeed skeptical of current BEM outputs, or if increased model precision would even improve the marketplace’s use of BEM tools.</p>
<p>Several reviewers also raised significant questions about the project team’s ability to manage its approach. On one hand, reviewers were united in their agreement that the project team’s decision to thoughtfully distribute the project’s tasks to particular national labs—those with the appropriate expertise and experimental facilities to conduct the work—was a notable strength of this project. One reviewer, however, was very critical of the project team’s ability to manage risk, expressing concern about the challenges that LBNL faced and believing that these challenges could have been anticipated given stronger risk management. Another reviewer similarly expressed that the project may have suffered from scope creep, which negatively impacted the project team’s ability to deliver on its goals.</p>
<p>Reviewers reserved some of their strongest criticisms and lowest scores for the project’s progress to date. Several reviewers acknowledged that some useful empirical data had been produced for review by ASHRAE, and that these data had met key project milestones. A few reviewers questioned the usefulness of these results, however, citing instrumentation problems at LBNL that could have systematically produced inaccurate results. Another reviewer believed that this data had been generated by what “appear[ed] to be well designed and instrumented test installations,” but the reviewer was “disappointed” by the “limited amount of reported results that the project ha[d] generated” from “a very small set of tests under very simple sets of [test] conditions.”</p>
<p>All but one reviewer expressed doubt about the team’s trajectory with respect to completing its remaining work. Three reviewers agreed that a significant amount of work remained to address the “discrepancies” and “unresolved problems” identified during initial validation, while a fourth noted that no explicit plan for addressing issues had been proposed. One reviewer also said that it was unlikely the project could achieve stated goals because the project team would need to conduct an “exhaustive set of test cases” that were likely beyond the scope of the project to accomplish.</p>
<p>Reviewers assigned the highest scores, and gave the most affirmative remarks, for the project’s “broad” and “complementary” set of collaborators, who reviewers believed generally worked well together. One reviewer, however, lamented the lack of an industry voice and proposed a potential follow-on research task to coordinate with specific product manufacturers to support third-party external validation.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Nearly every reviewer commended this project’s approach to modularizing OpenStudio, refining its user interface, and enhancing its diffusion and user-responsiveness. Several reviewers made supportive comments about the wisdom of reducing the size of the OpenStudio executable, enhancing the server, and putting OpenStudio on GitHub—thus allowing the project team to directly engage with other software developers to improve the tool and increase marketplace awareness. One reviewer said that the project’s approach was highly likely to overcome barriers, technical challenges, and mitigate project risks, while several others directly credited the changes and improvements made to OpenStudio for the “rapid onboarding” of new users over the past year. 
<p>Several reviewers expressed that the project team could improve its outreach to new users, specifically those who were not advanced programmers who frequented GitHub. According to one reviewer, online tools were in place that provided “a feedback loop from one specific user-community, [but] other OpenStudio users (potential 3rd party tool developers) may not be reached from that method.” Another reviewer expressed that the project team could also better communicate the differences between OpenStudio’s suite of tools and the underlying OpenStudio software development kit (SDK), calling this distinction something that had historically confused the BEM community.
<p>Reviewers were extremely supportive of this project’s potential impact. One reviewer said plainly that “without [OpenStudio], the benefits of taxpayer investments in EnergyPlus would not be realized.” Another reviewer said this project had already made a significant impact on the number of users who adopted EnergyPlus, as well as the number of stakeholders who were supporting further development of OpenStudio. A third reviewer credited this project as having a strong influence on the achievement of BTO’s goals, citing that OpenStudio had become “one of the key drivers of BEM use.”
<p>All reviewers were encouraged by this project’s progress. Reviewers highlighted OpenStudio’s greatly enhanced download rate and its increasing integration into other customer-facing tools. One reviewer called the introduction of the “lightweight” OpenStudio SDK “a significant milestone,” while another noted the addition of new features and capabilities that “expanded functionality to better support the development of practitioner tools.” Another reviewer said that the project had met “every milestone to date” and was “accelerating the use of BEM across federal and state agencies and the private sector.” With respect to the project’s remaining work, reviewers generally expressed confidence in the team’s plans and capacity to continue meeting its remaining milestones, with several positively commenting on the project team’s ongoing efforts to refactor OpenStudio tools in preparation for eventual integration with the Spawn of EnergyPlus BEM engine.
<p>While reviewers underscored the important role that the project’s collaborations played in its success to date, a few reviewers still highlighted that the project team could better engage the broader simulation tool developer community, to enable the development and integration of other tools into the OpenStudio SDK, and by doing so further advance EnergyPlus’ adoption goals. Another reviewer expressed their desire for the publication of a software roadmap for the user-facing tools and the SDK, describing that the current lack of such a roadmap “prevent[ed] or significantly delay[ed]” third parties from strategically planning and executing their own transitions to OpenStudio. A different reviewer thought the team’s efforts had largely operated without much industry input, which they cited as a weakness the team could improve upon moving forward. </p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers strongly approved of this project’s approach to improving and increasing the adoption of EnergyPlus, commenting that the approach was strong, forward looking, and engaged a wide group of stakeholders. One reviewer highlighted the project team’s well established process for identifying new EnergyPlus features and priorities, and then executing them in an open-source mode, while another remarked that the EnergyPlus features being developed during the current period of performance made sense and were addressing important industry needs.</p>
<p>In terms of project impact, one reviewer described EnergyPlus as a key underpinning of DOE's analysis workflows, commenting further that investments in this project paid dividends far beyond DOE's efforts to improve its own activities. Another reviewer similarly commented that this project was making a significant contribution to the development of a common measurement system for predicting and evaluating the performance of buildings. A third reviewer highlighted that EnergyPlus was foundational to BTO’s research, private sector applications, and individual BEM users. Another remarked on this project’s significant impact on the adoption of EnergyPlus for all stages of high performance building design analysis, pointing to fact that EnergyPlus had become one of the most widely used BEM tools with over 40,000 downloads.</p>
<p>Reviewers described this project’s progress as “good” and “significant,” with one reviewer highlighting that every milestone had been met to this point. One reviewer noted that this project was ""long term,"" but also that the project team had created systems and processes to ensure that progress towards long-term goals was maintained. Looking forward, one reviewer acknowledged that the project was likely to extend in “some way, shape, or form” for many years, but they also noted that project work envisioned for the immediate future was logically planned and would continue the project team’s effort to expand EnergyPlus’ capabilities, uptake, and impact. One reviewer noted that planned activities would help improve EnergyPlus compatibility and support new interfaces and workflow, and called EnergyPlus’ planned convergence with the Spawn of EnergyPlus software impressive. One reviewer, however, recommended that the project team also look at ways to help users better understand and resolve error messages, which would help increase user confidence and assure the quality of simulation results.</p>
<p>While one reviewer considered the collaboration and coordination activities of this project to be “adequate given the [project’s] large scale,” another reviewer called the project “an impressive collaborative effort.” Other reviewers shared this second assessment, with one highlighting that the EnergyPlus development team included a large number of stakeholders, subcontractors, and national labs all working together effectively. This reviewer continued by describing how the project’s robust teaming model had functioned well over several years, and continued to demonstrate improvements by working with ASHRAE, IBPSA, and other industry organizations.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Reviewers agreed with this project’s approach to developing a next-generation building energy modeling (BEM) engine—Spawn of EnergyPlus (SOEP). Reviewers described the approach as well thought-out, strong, and highly likely to contribute to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. One reviewer highlighted that the approach drew on international efforts, used open standards, and leveraged existing DOE tools, while another noted that the approach allowed for parallel development of SOEP and EnergyPlus—thus ensuring that the transition to SOEP would have minimal impact on users.</p>
<p>One reviewer described this project as representing the “next generation” of performance capabilities for DOE-funded energy analysis tools and simulation workflows, while another commented that the project's impact, if it was successful, would contribute significantly towards DOE's ability to evaluate and measure progress towards its goals. One reviewer noted that the project addressed many shortcomings of current BEM engines, while also adding needed capabilities for new use cases that could expand the use and impact of modeling. Another reviewer cautioned, however, that while the project’s use of advanced techniques would improve simulation methods and could help model complex control system strategies, it might not satisfy a “critical need” for the achievement of greater energy savings.</p>
<p>Reviewers commented that the project team had made good progress so far, and that the project work appeared to be on track, with all milestones to date having been met. Reviewers also remarked that the remaining milestones appeared straightforward to accomplish, with one reviewer opining that the project team’s highly technical and specialized experience made them “uniquely qualified to develop and implement the [SOEP] simulation engine and successfully complete the remaining project work.” One reviewer warned, however, that the project was nearing several “crux points,” and that it remained to be seen how efficiently and effectively the project team would be able to deploy resources to accomplish the necessary tasks.</p>
<p>Reviewers described this project as an impressive collaborative effort. One reviewer remarked that the project team was actively engaging a wide group of stakeholders that were appropriate for the current stage of the research, expressing confidence that the project team was sufficiently leveraging collaboration and coordination opportunities. Another reviewer cautioned, however, that SOEP likely required technical knowledge which exceeded that of the typical BEM user, encouraging the project team to undertake additional educational and outreach efforts to prepare industry to embrace the project’s advanced modeling approach.</p>"

<p><b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF REVIEWER COMMENTS</b></p>
<p>Most reviewers found value in this project’s approach to extending the functionality of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s (LBNL) Commercial Building Energy Saver (CBES) Pro software and further integrating it with Lucid’s BuildingOS. These reviewers commented positively on the ways that this project leveraged and combined the capabilities of two different tools to provide enhanced retrofit analysis services—with an improved user interface—to a larger population of buildings. One reviewer, however, was very critical of the approach, remarking that it appeared to conflict with parallel investments in other DOE tools while “help[ing] a private sector commercial company achieve…short and medium term goals.” Consequently, this reviewer found it difficult to see how the approach contributed to meeting national energy efficiency goals. Another reviewer similarly cautioned that it was important to ensure that LBNL's efforts to provide benefit to Lucid through this project were in balance with the public benefit that resulted from such engagement.</p>
<p>Most reviewers felt that this project was likely to have significant impact, with the enhancements made to CBES enabling Lucid’s BuildingOS to tap into its large building database to identify new efficiency opportunities. One reviewer commented that the project was likely to contribute to BTO’s program goals because it could provide stakeholders with an initial ""reality check"" of potential savings from energy conservation measures. Another reviewer, however, felt that DOE funding would have had a greater impact if it had been invested in DOE’s own data tools rather than CBES, a LBNL licensed product; this reviewer was also unclear about the benefit to DOE from investments that improved Lucid’s “ability to impact their customers.”</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that this project was making good progress, with one commenting that the project team had demonstrated a well thought-out plan and schedule for completing the project's goals on time and on budget. Reviewers also observed that the two primary stakeholders in this effort, Lucid and LBNL, were working well together in developing project deliverables. Given these assessments, reviewers agreed that the project’s overall scope was reasonable, that remaining project work seemed achievable within the remaining project timeline, and that the project team was therefore very likely to meet project-specific goals.</p>"
