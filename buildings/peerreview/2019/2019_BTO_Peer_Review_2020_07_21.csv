<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers had a favorable view of the project's approach to test the use of network switches in the operation of lighting and plug loads in office buildings. Multiple reviewers noted the importance of answering these research questions and determining the potential energy savings for this technology. One reviewer commended the staged implementation of the project whereby the project team could learn from the experiences of the first project sites and use that knowledge to inform the second set. However, another reviewer noted that the project was focused more on the technology deployment and less on understanding and solving the actual barriers. Others saw the potential for improvement in the Power over Ethernet (PoE) project with one reviewer highlighting the importance of solving the problem of added loads coming from the router.</p>
<p>As for the project impact, reviewers disagreed over the project's potential contribution to program goals with some reviewers uncertain whether utilizing PoE would result in energy savings. Two reviewers recommended recalculating the national savings potential with different assumptions in order to reach a more representative estimate. A different reviewer remarked that the project will likely provide a clear understanding of the potential energy savings of the technology as well as any implementation challenges. On the other hand, another reviewer commented that this study ""positions DOE BTO to be a leader in conversations about intelligent buildings.""</p>
<p>Overall, a majority of reviewers described progress as ""advancing as expected"" and ""aligned with the individual project goals."" These reviewers also mentioned that the project team already produced meaningful results about the presence of parasitic loads, stating that the team's finding was ""likely to shape the industry's path forward in developing this technology."" Conversely, one reviewer raised the concern that only two buildings have been evaluated, which they stated was far from demonstrating wide-scale deployment success.</p>
<p>Many reviewers expressed a positive outlook of the team's collaboration and coordination efforts for the current stage of the research. One reviewer highlighted the partnerships with the two architecture firms and, also, the cost-share element of the project with funding from the State of Minnesota. In terms of future collaboration and scaling the technology, reviewers suggested engaging with industry and other stakeholders like utilities.</p>
<p>Comparable to their comments on the project's impact, reviewers were split on their evaluation of the remaining work. While four of the reviewers found the remaining project work to be appropriate with the presented schedule and goals, the other two stated their concerns. One of those reviewers noticed that the presentation lacked future steps to identify and address the obstacles from the demonstrations. The second reviewer found that the team still needed to make significant progress before they could explicitly show project success.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Generally, the reviewers took issue with the project's approach to developing an HVAC system that dampens fluctuations in the pricing of the electric grid. Although the project is in its early stages, reviewers found the modeling was too detailed, and the project did not incorporate the development of new technologies. One reviewer noted that the complexities and regulations introduced with this project's approach will not be worth the savings it may attain. As a suggestion for a more cost-effective approach, one reviewer recommended conducting a theoretical study that could highlight a critical area of research in the proposed system.</p>
<p>Many reviewers commented that if the proposed system were successful, it could theoretically have an impact in improving grid reliability. However, given the high costs of the phase change material (PCM) and limited promotion of the technology by utilities, the majority of the reviewers cautioned that adoption would be unlikely.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers were pleased with the project's collaboration, commending the good number of experts, academic collaborators, advisors and credentials for the task. More critically, one reviewer would like to have seen more end-user and installer involvement, as market adoption without government incentives can be a challenge.</p>
<p>Despite the early stage, most reviewers agreed that progress has been made on track and on schedule. However, one reviewer noted that little progress had been made in this effort up to this point. Reviewers were conflicted on the remaining project work. While some found it to be clearly outlined and reasonable, others found that the final phases may fall short of getting real-world input to drive significant value.</p>
<p>The reviewers applauded the project for its strong team, simple approach, and technical strengths, however they did raise concerns regarding the project team's understanding of the general physics of PCMs, the economic viability of the project, and the practicality and cost-competitiveness of any prototype. To address these challenges, reviewers did make recommendations: two reviewers recommended the involvement of manufacturers as soon as possible, while another reviewer suggested performing a detailed techno-economic analysis.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The research staff at LBNL is actively seeking additional industry partners and is currently in discussions to partner with three private entities, including an energy storage manufacturer, a solar panel company, and a battery installer, who have expressed support for the project concept. The project team will focus more on a techno-economic analysis to demonstrate the economic viability of this technology solution in future project plans and reviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project staff also agree that the project needs more real-world input, and they have hence focused on industry engagement as a core part of this work. Furthermore, the team will elaborate on the multiple potential business model concepts identified through collaborations with the iCorps program. The team has also added a new team member who can bolster their expertise on PCM building physics.</p>",Field Validation & Data Frameworks (CBI)

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The majority of reviewers found the approach to be favorable, though they identified the lack of empirical information on the subject as a major gap and noted the need to characterize the field with this early research. The resulting research outcomes were described by one reviewer as valuable, although they also noted that the project team should have chosen studies that explored more insightful research questions. Reviewer feedback also highlighted the importance of understanding what drives building design decisions and how energy savings plays into that decision-making process.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers had positive comments regarding the project impact with multiple reviewers stating the importance of disseminating the project results. Although reviewers noted the difficulty linking project impact to a decrease in energy savings, they insisted that the findings would help the energy-efficiency community better understand the landscape. One reviewer stressed the need to understand whether acknowledgment that a certain technology can lead to energy savings is motivation enough to push the market to adopt efficiency measures. Reviewers also stated that the results could help justify regulatory involvement instead of market-based solutions.</p>
<p>The project progress and the team's collaborations were both highly rated by the reviewers. Four of the reviewers had positive feedback on progress with the fifth citing inconclusive results and a delayed schedule as justification for the ""fair"" rating. While one reviewer suggested further partnering efforts with organizations, most of the reviewers described the project as having great collaboration with both academia and the real estate industry. Reviewers generally applauded the project's engagement and inclusion of different perspectives and areas of expertise.</p>
<p>In terms of the remaining work, reviewers mainly affirmed that the scope was clearly planned and consistent with project goals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The approach to the Smart Energy Analytics Campaign was well-received by reviewers as a solution to address the lack of adoption in Energy Management and Information Systems (EMIS), and the associated loss of operational savings. Reviewers stated that the use of a DOE Campaign was ""the perfect tool to spread awareness and comfort with EMIS systems,"" comprising an excellent approach. Several reviewers remarked that the project team had done a great job of engaging building owners and operators about their experiences using the technology. Success stories and cost-benefit information was also mentioned as part of the approach to encourage further adoption. In addition, a reviewer suggested that the team establish a long-term method to spread awareness and lessons learned by creating an EMIS course for trade schools and universities.</p>
<p>The project impact also received positive feedback and was described as addressing real-world challenges to energy-efficiency measures. Reviewers highlighted the benefits that this project would bring to the building management community and commented that it would likely achieve real savings while contributing to BTO's goals specific to the existing building stock. However, one reviewer stated that the team's estimated impact was overstated compared to the reviewer's internal calculations and hence suggested re-examining the figures to confirm they are representing a realistic estimate for the target commercial buildings market.</p>
<p>Reviewers found both the project progress and the team's collaboration and coordination efforts to be very positive. The project was said to be progressing well with good results in accordance with the presented schedule. As a DOE campaign, reviewers noted that the project was largely about collaboration and that the team had outstandingly engaged all the relevant stakeholders. The collaboration was said to reach a wide audience of all the relevant stakeholders. Another reviewer recommended that the peer network continue even after the project is finished in order to ensure stakeholders can benefit from the structured collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the remainder of the project, reviewers looked favorably on the planned work and final steps for the DOE campaign. The majority of reviewers found the remaining work to be logical and consistent with the overall project goals. One reviewer noted that the team produced research and resources that have ""already served as a powerful resource for property owners and managers.""</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team will continue to engage with building owners at any stage in the process of adoption and work to ensure that its calculations of the relevant target market size and estimates of technical potential are based on the best available data. The team will also review its stakeholder engagement efforts and reporting activities to clarify its approach to engaging building owners and reporting savings and successful strategies as appropriate.</p>",Field Validation & Data Frameworks (CBI)

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project approach received mixed comments, though reviewers agreed that the purpose of the project aligned with DOE program goals in addressing retrofits to existing buildings and that the technology was more likely to succeed in the commercial sector. Some reviewers found the prefabricated approach promising, while others noted the challenges that face the project team. In particular, several reviewers brought attention to the need to optimize the size of the panels, improve the installation process, and gain acceptance by the construction industry. One reviewer also suggested utilizing construction techniques that already exist in order to minimize the need to further train tradespeople.</p>
<p>Reviewers were also split on the potential impact that the new panels would provide. Multiple reviewers reiterated the need for improvement of current retrofit technology and the potential of overclad technology. Reviewers remarked that adoption would depend greatly on the overall cost and the long-term performance of the panels so more research is needed to determine market potential. It was noted that public acceptance might be limited due to factors such as high cost, complexity of installation, and panel geometry. One reviewer recommended getting more specific feedback from stakeholders about the proposed technology and the joint design between panels.</p>
<p>The majority of reviewers agreed that the project was progressing as planned, but they acknowledged that the project was at an early stage, which made it difficult to judge. The team's work on panel design and testing of the new apparatus was cited as progress and described as the groundwork for the remainder of the project.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The majority of reviewers found the project approach for an IoT-enabled troffer lighting challenge to be positive and appropriate for the goal of advancing the adoption of energy-efficient connected lighting. Reviewers commented on the decision to issue a challenge to manufacturers and noted that the approach ""maximizes the chance of success"" and is ""a great way to push lighting controls forward."" However, one reviewer remarked that they were unclear whether this particular technology goal was an appropriate application of the challenge approach. In terms of the challenge's goals, one reviewer stated that the barrier to adoption of smart troffer lighting was not necessarily technical but more a lack of demand for the capability. On the other hand, a separate reviewer cited the high cost of the technology as the barrier, which they explained would be addressed in the project.</p>
<p>Comments on the impact of a ""future-ready"" troffer lighting challenge varied with reviewers disagreeing on the potential contribution to DOE goals. One reviewer expressed that the project could have a significant impact on almost the whole commercial building stock, while others found it more difficult to assess the level of energy savings that could be expected. Since the cost target for the challenge was not chosen, reviewers were uncertain whether there would be a strong business case for the technology leading to higher stakeholder uptake.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted the early stage of the project but agreed that it was progressing as planned and according to the schedule. In terms of progress, one reviewer highlighted the limited engagement with manufacturers and suggested that this step in the process should occur earlier in the project. A few other reviewers agreed that the team's collaboration could be improved, recommending coordination with state and local governments as well as utilities, Better Buildings, and a code making body. Contrary to the other opinions, one reviewer stated that there were no identifiable gaps in the collaboration plan.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project approach received positive comments from reviewers and several reviewers approved of the team's decision to use a lighting retrofit opportunity to combine and manage multiple end uses (HVAC, lighting, and plug loads). In terms of deployment, the reviewers appreciated the idea of developing controls packages for utility portfolios and remarked that the team's approach could effectively address the cost barrier to lighting controls. Despite the positive comments, a couple of reviewers were uncertain whether the team could achieve the presented whole building energy savings with one reviewer describing the nationwide impact as ""unrealistically large."" Another reviewer noted that during the project, the team would learn about installation and commissioning challenges, which would lead to a better estimate of the potential savings.</p>
<p>Many of the reviewers found great potential in the project's impact with the condition that the team could demonstrate cost-effectiveness of the proposed controls package. Reviewers reiterated their position that the impact estimate was overstated and suggested that the team recalculate the figure as well as break it down by HVAC, lighting, and plug load savings. One of the reviewers also mentioned that there was a lack of market assessment and social research conducted by the team. The reviewer followed up by saying, ""simply developing a great technology solution is insufficient to guarantee market uptake."" It was recommended that the team validate and quantify the savings in multiple building types and continue to pursue the approach of utility program offerings.</p>
<p>Overall, the team's progress was applauded by reviewers and described as ""an impressive start, which may be indicative of strong probability of ultimate project success."" While reviewers remarked on the team's difficulty finding suitable sites, the majority of reviewers found that the project was progressing well, and the findings were well-documented.</p>
<p>With regards to collaboration and coordination efforts, reviewers were split with comments ranging from ""fair"" to ""outstanding."" Many reviewers highlighted the pilot program with the utility in Minnesota and agreed that this approach was likely to drive adoption. Some reviewers commended the team's wide variety of stakeholders, but others noted that the project was somewhat internally focused and provided recommendations for potential partnerships with other organizations.

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers were split on the project's approach to achieve deep heating savings through submetering and behavior change in multifamily buildings. Several reviewers commented on the studies that were conducted in the European Union (EU) with many reviewers citing this as a strength. However, they also highlighted the cultural differences between the U.S. and the EU and warned that the team should not assume that the same approach will save energy in the U.S. as well. A reviewer also mentioned their uncertainty regarding the project's success with commercial multi-tenant buildings due to the longer lease terms and the more complex nature of the buildings. A separate reviewer commented that the narrow approach to multifamily buildings with central heat was appropriate due to the potential savings and large size of the sector.</p>
<p>Similarly, reviewers were divided on the project impact and many noted potential areas of improvement for the project team to consider. The majority of reviewers were uncertain about the exact level of contribution this project would have toward DOE goals. With the project's narrow focus, reviewers questioned how relevant the research would be for different building types and/or different climate zones. Another main topic of contention among reviewers was the impact of behavior change. While some reviewers expressed doubt as to its application in real-world scenarios, others viewed behavior change as a cost-effective strategy to lower energy consumption. In terms of adoption, one reviewer stressed the importance of developing a good method for billing that would be appropriate for both tenants and building owners.</p>
<p>Reviewer feedback on project progress and stakeholder engagement tended to agree more frequently, and comments were fairly uniform. Despite a minor setback with finding suitable participants, several reviewers commented positively about the team's progress in installing the equipment and collecting data. Other reviewers noted that the project was still relatively early in the presented schedule, even though many of the key hurdles were already addressed including preliminary stakeholder engagement. Numerous reviewers approved of the team's collaboration efforts and described them as ""excellent across all stakeholders.""

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers were divided about the project team's approach to develop and test integrated solutions for optimized performance (ISOP) packages. The project was applauded by some reviewers in part due to its holistic and straightforward strategy to coordinate between building systems. However, other reviewers expressed concerns that the approach did not do enough to address the major barriers to adoption. There was also confusion surrounding the specific energy-efficiency measures that the project team would install and monitor. One reviewer commented that the solution might be too specific for the team's partner site, which, they said, could lead utilities to the decision not to adopt the project as a full utility rebate program.</p>
<p>The disagreement between reviewers continued for both project impact and overall progress. While many reviewers argued that the partnership with the utility could have a major impact on energy savings, others were uncertain whether the potential was overstated and unrealistic. Several reviewers suggested that the team provide clarity on how each individual technology would save energy and then further clarify how the energy conservation measures would work together in synergy. According to these reviewers, the impact would depend significantly on the technologies chosen by the individual participants, so the estimated impact presented should be reassessed. In terms of project progress, many reviewers mentioned the contracting and procurement challenges with the partner site.</p>
<p>Comments on the team's collaboration and coordination efforts were more uniform with reviewers highlighting the relationship and cost-share between the project team, manufacturers, partner site, and utility. Many of the reviewers stated that additional building owners and utilities should be added and suggested sharing more information on the teams plan to expand their efforts after the initial research. It was unclear to reviewers whether there would be a focus on higher education or all commercial building types. For this reason, a reviewer made the distinction that the project was ""more of an experiment from which a broader-based pilot could be developed to move closer to the replicability anticipated in the goals."" Additionally, one of the reviewers commended the project's inclusion of ASHRAE guideline 36 and acknowledged that the team was considering standardization.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers approved of the project's approach and several reviewers mentioned that AFDD technology has been commercially available for some time but has lacked adoption due to a number of market barriers. AFDD was described as an example of a technology that ""has a ton of technical potential but suffers in uptake due to a lack of awareness, trust, and (perhaps) data overload."" The reviewers commended the project team's goal of researching and characterizing these market challenges but identified areas of improvement. It was suggested that the team should engage further with key decision makers like building owners and management firms as well as include field studies specific to office buildings.</p>
<p>The project impact was well-received due to its focus on reducing energy and operating costs associated with HVAC systems in existing buildings. One of the reviewers highlighted the team's goal of having utilities offer FDD rebates as a means of increasing adoption of the technology. Another reviewer was pleased with how the team developed the monitoring element for the field sites but was uncertain how the lessons learned would be scaled to the market. Another noted concern was the importance of installing the technology such that it does not overwhelm the operator and makes their jobs easier instead of more complicated. If implemented in a user-friendly way, reviewers reiterated the potential of AFDD to provide both energy and cost savings.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed about the current project progress and had a range of comments on the team's efforts to engage stakeholders. While some reviewers noted that the project was progressing well and according to plan, others expressed concerns that the team was too focused on the technical challenges as opposed to understanding and addressing the barriers to adoption. Similarly, many reviewers found the team's collaboration thorough with a broad group of identified stakeholders. However, the other reviewers commented that the project's definition of stakeholder was too narrow and omitted both management companies and those who would actually be using the technology such as building engineers, facility operators, and owners. A reviewer concluded by stressing the importance of education and training when installing new technologies like FDD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers found the project approach to optimize integrated systems packages for real estate lifecycle events to be very sound. The premise was applauded for the project's inherent strategy to look at energy efficiency from the perspective of existing real estate industry practices. Several reviewers commented that the project would result in increased uptake in energy conservation improvements and lead to cost and energy savings for building owners. While one reviewer agreed with the other three reviewers about the approach, they questioned how the team would successfully disseminate the results across the industry.</p>
<p>In terms of the potential impact, reviewers agreed that the project could contribute significantly to BTO goals by increasing adoption of deep energy-efficiency upgrades and addressing the existing building stock. Reviewers stressed the importance of developing packages that are not too disruptive and that balance effectiveness with market viability in order to ensure widespread adoption by the real estate industry. The idea of incorporating this strategy into a utility incentive program was mentioned as an effective method to increase participation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the early stage of the project, comments on progress were overwhelmingly positive as all of the reviewers rated the section as either ""Excellent"" or ""Good."" Two reviewers highlighted stakeholder engagement as an area that was particularly strong at this phase of the project, while a different reviewer agreed, but mentioned that the next stage of the project where the team actually develops the packages will be the real challenge. The same reviewer continued and noted that the team has had ""a good start with their improved understanding of stakeholder needs from the front-end work.""</p>
<p>Collaboration was generally well-regarded, and the majority of reviewers considered stakeholder engagement to be one of the project's main strengths. The stakeholder group was described as ""well-considered"" and ""one of the most impressive aspects of this project."" One reviewer stated that keeping the group engaged throughout the project would be critical to its success. On the other hand, another reviewer offered suggestions of potential organizations for further partnership opportunities. Also of note, a reviewer questioned whether it was necessary to do original field research to validate the savings from the packages. The reviewer followed up and noted that if the team utilized pre-measured packages, the project could focus more completely on understanding the market barriers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers found the Getting Beyond Widgets project to have a strong approach that was likely to succeed. Most reviewers noted the need to validate the benefits and savings of a systems approach so as to justify support from utilities. It was further stated that utility incentive programs would help address the high cost and misperception that energy-efficiency projects are complex and disruptive. One reviewer commended the approach but recommended that the team increase the number of building owner and utility partners associated with the project.</p>
<p>The ratings and comments on impact were overwhelmingly positive with three out of four reviewers scoring the project impact as ""Outstanding."" Reviewers remarked on the project's clear alignment with DOE's program goals especially with regards to improved energy efficiency in existing buildings. A reviewer commented that the packages appear viable but would need the support of utilities in order to spur adoption. There was uncertainty surrounding the uptake of the first cohort's projects, which the reviewer stressed was important to consider when evaluating the project's value and impact.</p>
<p>While reviewers were generally complementary about how the project was progressing, their comments on collaboration and coordination were slightly more critical. One reviewer began by recognizing the level of stakeholder engagement, but then noted the lack of participation from commercial building owners. The reviewer continued and remarked that while working with the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), and energy service companies (ESCOs) was a great starting place, these organizations likely have viewpoints that differ significantly from other building owners. It was also mentioned that there are plans to engage more professionals in the building space such as architects, engineers, and designers.</p>
<p>As for the remaining project work, most reviewers found the team's plan to be consistent with the presented schedule of work. One reviewer disagreed and stated that the team needed to engage additional stakeholders in order to ensure adoption by utilities. The same reviewer noted that utilities are not positioned to deploy these programs so the project team would need to address these remaining barriers before the utilities could successfully administer a Beyond Widgets program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers were split regarding the team's approach to the building-level direct current (DC) distribution system project &ndash; several reviewers provided positive comments and the remaining two offered suggestions for improvement. One reviewer commended the team's decision to begin by defining obstacles and noted that this approach made it more likely that the team would overcome the identified barriers. Similarly, another reviewer mentioned that due to the early nature of the research on the topic, the team's wide perspective would be useful in determining barriers and potential solutions. Some of the reviewers expressed concern that the research was either too focused on lab-level details or had already been completed in-part by other projects. To address these issues, reviewers recommended concentrating more on defining and overcoming the technical and market barriers as opposed to measuring energy savings.</p>
<p>In terms of the potential impact of the project, reviewer comments were also mixed with a variety of outlooks given on the future use of DC in buildings. While reviewers were uncertain how quickly results could be expected, several reviewers agreed that this project would be beneficial in the long term and could possibly position DOE as a leader in the field. However, one reviewer questioned how widespread DC distribution systems would actually be in the future but noted the importance of the study in developing a baseline. In addition, reviewers emphasized the importance of including a quantification of benefits for buildings with on-site solar photovoltaics (PV), electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, and/or battery systems.</p>
<p>The comments on progress were generally more uniform, as reviewers agreed that the early stage of the project made it difficult to determine. On the other hand, reviewers had opposing impressions of the team's collaboration efforts ranging from ""Outstanding"" to ""Fair."" Two of the reviewers applauded the team's stakeholder engagement and described the team as ""collaborating deeply with all of the relevant parties."" Conversely, the other reviewers recommended further stakeholder engagement and suggested working with more designers, building contractors, and owners earlier in the process. It was also mentioned that adding another 2-4 sites would be a potential challenge for the team to secure in the allotted time and could jeopardize the remaining work.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team acknowledged reviewer comments and will better clarify the project's approach does not involve lab-level measurements and will not reproduce existing research. Industry stakeholders, through the Technical Advisory Group (TAG), stressed that third-party validation is lacking and necessary to promote technology in addition to addressing technical and market barriers. The team noted that its revised work plan will include appropriate updates to address this feedback.</p>",Technology Systems & Packages (CBI)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The approach for the project to embed energy efficiency and distributed energy resources (DERs) into advanced manufacturing of buildings was generally well-received. Several reviewers applauded the team's partnerships with the modular construction industry and cited this collaboration as the predominant factor that would lead to the project's ultimate success. While reviewers appreciated that the team took the perspective of another industry, two of the reviewers expressed concern with maintaining the industry's engagement and disseminating results and information. The established industry advisory group was also mentioned in coordination with the offsite construction factory partnerships.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed slightly about the potential contribution that the project could have on DOE's energy-efficiency goals. The majority of reviewers recognized that offsite construction was an emerging trend, but their comments differed regarding the degree of energy savings and BTO's role in the industry's near-term growth. One reviewer noted that a baseline manufactured building will likely be more energy efficient than a building built on-site. The reviewer continued by explaining that the metric to consider in the project should be the ""marginal improvement between standard practice manufactured/modular buildings and the integrated solution this project is intended to develop.""</p>
<p>In terms of the team's progress and collaboration with its partners, reviewers found the project to be well-thought-through and progressing as expected. Several reviewers commended the engagement with stakeholders with one reviewer highlighting the three secured partnership agreements as confirmation of the significant progress the team has made in the short period of time. It was recommended that the team expand their collaboration to include more factories, contractors, architects, and engineers. Also, reviewers suggested partnering with specific project groups and organizations in order to broaden stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>The reviewers raised multiple unanswered questions about the project's remaining work and provided additional comments for the team to consider moving forward. One reviewer inquired about the presented flowchart idea that would document the manufacturing process and was uncertain whether the process would be applicable to more than one manufacturer. Another reviewer proposed using the Better Buildings format to model the development of a peer network so that the factories could work together on energy improvements.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the scope identifies and targets key barriers and technical challenges that are appropriate for DOE to address. The initial technical barriers and challenges being addressed by this subprogram are appropriate for DOE to address and, when done in concert with the market, DOE is a critical catalyst in this area and can activate market channels. Overall, the Building Data subprogram is on target with its scope. The stated goals align well with the overall BTO goals and are appropriate for a government role in the energy-efficiency space.</p>
<p>Some reviewers expressed concerns about one overlooked barrier, the issue of cross-adoption within the industry. One of the biggest barriers in the building industry is the disconnect between building design and building operations. Another concern expressed was related to EDV and whether it is really solving a critical barrier in a direct way. There is skepticism that utilities will see enough value in the EDV approach to entice them to participate.</p>
<p>On the topic of the project's impact and the degree to which the portfolio is expected to contribute to program and BTO goals, the reviewers were split. Many reviewers agreed that the subprogram certainly advances the state-of-the-art (SOA) and the subprogram absolutely supports the industry. The BED portfolio advances the SOA by leveraging existing frameworks and accounting for future data needs or possible issues. Reviewers praised the industry stakeholders and partners involved. Examples of this include the use of the BEDES and BuildingSync, which specifically addresses a need to interact across different data sets, standards and software. The SEED platform also shows this support for industry, both large and small businesses, along with public organizations who are investing public funding in energy performance.</p>
<p>However, other reviewers disagreed, stating that the program does not seem to advance SOA or support industry as effectively as it could. Multiple reviewers suggested selling the value of some group of these initiatives to one or two adopters outside of the typical energy-efficiency players (e.g., realtors, code officials, building inspectors, mortgage lenders). Reviewers also expressed other concerns, such as DOE continuing to offer free SEED hosting, an effort that is diminishing the overall support of making SEED a meaningful tool for the marketplace, and the program's ability to meet the end-goals listed on slide 6.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that collaboration, coordination, and integration is a strength of this subprogram. Different projects within the BED portfolio complement one another and work in unison to ensure consistency, transparency, and quality. The portfolio coordinates among residential and commercial buildings and emerging technologies programs, allowing for consistency among the various related sectors. There also seems to be a very good use of channel partners, such as the API development licenses from the BPD and the integration of the SEED platform with other open and public system platforms, along with third-party hosting providers.</p>
<p>Many reviewers suggested additional outreach and collaboration with certain groups. There could be a stronger connection to GIS mapping organizations who produce what is considered to be open and closed data. Further outreach should be provided to property management firms and other entities with large building portfolios (e.g., universities with multiple campuses, multiple buildings, etc.). Some reviewers expressed that DOE could do a better job of leveraging channel partners.</p>
<p>Furthermore, reviewers generally agreed that the BED portfolio acknowledges the large variety of public and private stakeholders and works to continually identify relevant parties. Everyone from industry groups to public sector to NGOs and utilities are at the table. However, one reviewer did express skepticism if the identified stakeholders are active participants (such as Building America) versus folks who have agreed that the results would be useful if obtained quickly.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the webpages of all programs that are in operation are generally clear and provide good communication on updates as they evolve. From newsletters, partner announcements, and the structure of recognizing partner organizations, there is constant communication and those participating instantly know when success happens. A few reviewers expressed thoughts that the plan to communicate accomplishments and lessons could be strengthened.</p>
<p>As for metrics, many reviewers expressed uncertainty about what the progress and impact metrics were. As a result, it was somewhat hard for the reviewers to evaluate all the projects in terms of their performance across the chosen metrics. Although reviewers generally agreed that progress is being made, some reviewers suggested that the Building Data subprogram would be well-served to develop some specific metrics (e.g., square footage entered into various tools, cumulative ""size"" of programs leveraging SEED, etc.) that they can begin to track.</p>
<p>Reviewers did identify some tracked metrics, such as unique logins to the tools, number of schema mapped, and number of buildings scored with Asset Score. Number of organizations adopting tools is a good starting point for a metric (e.g., 30 organizations have adopted BEDES). However, it would be helpful to have metrics that further determine the degree to which this has achieved the goals of standardization and interoperability of building energy data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the subprogram is successfully addressing an array of barriers and technical challenges. Reviewers generally agreed that the challenges identified are appropriate for the federal government to address and, as one reviewer pointed out, there are numerous precedents for federal government involvement in user interfaces and tools, as evidenced by the EPA ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (ESPM).</p>
<p>Reviewers also suggested additional barriers that the subprogram should be addressing. It was recommended that BTO also focus on improving BEM's value proposition for the design teams themselves and greater clarity may be needed on explicitly defining the long-term role of each ""tool"" in the ecosystem. Furthermore, reviewers suggested that the subprogram also address the lack of&nbsp;local authority awareness of how to specify appropriate BEM tools and their ability to review the results.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that this subprogram is contributing to advancing the state of the art and clearly supports BTO's energy-savings goals. Some reviewers expressed concerns that it may hamper current industry operations due to industry lagging behind in state-of-the-art practice adoption - there is disappointment in the non-vendor community with this shift. Additionally, one reviewer noted that vendors and end-users (energy modelers) can easily commit errors when entering the complex inputs for EnergyPlus/OpenStudio. Reviewers stated that the subprogram does contribute to BTO's energy-savings goals by providing quality tools for modeling energy savings, but some reviewers expressed that this relationship is not thoroughly quantified.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers suggested filling the industry gap in the meantime with tools that are simpler and faster than EnergyPlus/Modelica that make BEM more accessible to the general public. Another reviewer suggested that education programs and updated information repositories and certifications can help mitigate the gap by providing guidance and assurances to stakeholders and industry. As identified in the report, a shortage of trained energy modelers is another bottleneck that could be addressed through DOE projects.</p>
<p>With regards to collaboration, coordination, and integration, reviewers agreed that the subprogram is well-integrated and cohesive internally and well-positioned in relation to and well-coordinated with relevant public and private-sector organizations. Reviewers praised the subprogram's coordination within DOE, across other offices, as the tools developed within this subprogram have been used extensively within DOE to support other DOE subprograms and initiatives (e.g., codes, HVAC). The subprogram includes a wide portfolio of fundamental and ubiquitous tools and some reviewers found it difficult to keep track of the tools within the program.</p>
<p>Reviewers specifically mentioned BTO's continued engagement with IBPSA-USA and ASHRAE as most beneficial. DOE has provided support for projects like IBPSA-USA's Project StaSIO, which aims to raise awareness of ASHRAE 209 and provide good visual examples of data presentation to allow more conversations around BEM, its uses, and the specific questions it can answer. Reviewers generally agreed that initiatives are coordinated well with other public and private organizations such as AIA, gbXML.org, USGBC, and other NGOs, as well as tool vendors and equipment manufacturers.</p>
<p>Reviewers commented positively on the subprogram's communication and stakeholder engagement, agreeing that the subprogram actively integrates feedback from key stakeholders into the determination of barriers and initiatives to address them. These feedback loops are well-appreciated by the industry. Most reviewers also agreed that the subprogram disseminates information in a timely manner and quickly responds to user feedback and issues with new releases.</p>
<p>Reviewers appreciated the subprogram's efforts to provide information at relevant events. Subprogram efforts are often presented at conferences and this is very helpful for non-lab folks to know more about what is going on. BTO actively participates and engages in BEM industry events such as SimBuild and California's Software Symposium. Updates are also available at other venues such as IBPSA meetings, IES meetings, etc.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the subprogram is performing well according to its chosen metrics, but most reviewers had suggestions for additional metrics that the subprogram should be tracking. Metrics could look at how DOE is supporting industry initiatives beyond the software it provides and how that support allows new users of BEM to emerge. Another metric to be considered could be the actual cost of BEM per project (e.g., BEM cost per square foot or BEM cost per total project cost). Reviewers also suggested metrics such as number of licenses sold, number of simulations run (for an online license), and number of software users.</p>
<p>Reviewers also provided feedback for some of the subprogram's current metrics. One metric identified the percentage of new construction projects with energy models as reported in the AIA database (as well as type of software used). This is a good source of data that identifies buildings that have been modeled, but it doesn't necessarily show a true cross-section of commercial new construction in the U.S. Other reviewers commented that tracking the number of people downloading certain software doesn't necessarily capture the impact of the program.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers greatly approved of the Commercial Buildings Integration (CBI) Partnership portfolio, which included presentations about Advanced Energy Design Guides, DOE Campaigns, and the Better Buildings Initiative. The majority of reviewers indicated that the barriers and technical challenges that CBI identified were pressing and appropriate for the federal government to address. CBI's work with zero energy buildings, involvement in early-stage research and development (R&D), and work as a coordinating organization and clearinghouse were highlighted as great examples of the portfolio's effort to overcome technical and market barriers. One reviewer explained that CBI's involvement in R&D enables new technical solutions to become available sooner and with those advancements, the benefits are also realized earlier. A reviewer summed up their comments by stating, ""DOE is a trusted brand and an appropriate source of unbiased information on energy efficiency.""</p>
<p>In terms of how well CBI addresses the aforementioned challenges, reviewers agreed that the portfolio was extremely effective and has resulted in significant benefit across the commercial building sector. Several reviewers brought attention to the comprehensiveness of the portfolio's approach and mentioned the different outreach types in coordination with its impact. However, two reviewers expressed concern that CBI was not explicitly differentiating between the various segments such as Better Buildings Challenge (BBC), Better Buildings Alliance (BBA), Accelerators, Technology Challenges, and Campaigns. These reviewers were uncertain whether new partners would understand the differences without further communication.</p>
<p>While reviewers offered suggestions on additional challenges CBI could work to overcome, the consensus was that the team was not ignoring any significant barriers. Given the team's resources, many reviewers applauded the scope of the portfolio and noted how few gaps existed. Some of the recommendations included a focus on workforce barriers, a renewed effort to increase energy efficiency in existing buildings, and further partnership with utilities. Another gap that a reviewer identified was BTO's support for legislators and continued by suggesting a communication method between stakeholders.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers commended the team for their innovative approaches and provided examples of which aspects of the portfolio were particularly inventive. Specifically, reviewers remarked on DOE's industry challenges, the Green Lease Leaders Program, and CBI's work with communities and districts. While one reviewer commented that CBI had numerous innovative projects, they also noted that not all approaches need to be cutting-edge and that validating and promoting energy efficiency is an important contribution that BTO makes for the industry.</p>
<p>With regards to the impact of CBI's Partnership portfolio, reviewers were complimentary and demonstrated great support for the team's efforts. The majority of reviewers agreed that the portfolio advances the state of the market and noted that it brings early adopters into a position to demonstrate success. One reviewer mentioned that BTO has an even greater influence in areas of the country that do not prioritize energy-efficiency policy. Some of the programs referenced in conjunction with market advancement were industry challenges, Campaigns, and the Green Lease Leaders program.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments on CBI's support for industry and other key stakeholders were positive and most reviewers recognized that there were few gaps in engagement. A reviewer acknowledged that DOE listens to industry when establishing priorities, which they viewed as an important aspect of stakeholder engagement. Some of the reviewers reiterated that workforce development was an area that CBI could further support. The reviewers continued by mentioning that CBI is likely trying to work the relevant stakeholders, but the groups are often difficult to reach and influence.

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers greatly approved of the Commercial Buildings Integration (CBI) Partnership portfolio, which included presentations about Advanced Energy Design Guides, DOE Campaigns, and the Better Buildings Initiative. The majority of reviewers indicated that the barriers and technical challenges that CBI identified were pressing and appropriate for the federal government to address. CBI's work with zero energy buildings, involvement in early-stage research and development (R&D), and work as a coordinating organization and clearinghouse were highlighted as great examples of the portfolio's effort to overcome technical and market barriers. One reviewer explained that CBI's involvement in R&D enables new technical solutions to become available sooner and with those advancements, the benefits are also realized earlier. A reviewer summed up their comments by stating, ""DOE is a trusted brand and an appropriate source of unbiased information on energy efficiency.""</p>
<p>In terms of how well CBI addresses the aforementioned challenges, reviewers agreed that the portfolio was extremely effective and has resulted in significant benefit across the commercial building sector. Several reviewers brought attention to the comprehensiveness of the portfolio's approach and mentioned the different outreach types in coordination with its impact. However, two reviewers expressed concern that CBI was not explicitly differentiating between the various segments such as Better Buildings Challenge (BBC), Better Buildings Alliance (BBA), Accelerators, Technology Challenges, and Campaigns. These reviewers were uncertain whether new partners would understand the differences without further communication.</p>
<p>While reviewers offered suggestions on additional challenges CBI could work to overcome, the consensus was that the team was not ignoring any significant barriers. Given the team's resources, many reviewers applauded the scope of the portfolio and noted how few gaps existed. Some of the recommendations included a focus on workforce barriers, a renewed effort to increase energy efficiency in existing buildings, and further partnership with utilities. Another gap that a reviewer identified was BTO's support for legislators and continued by suggesting a communication method between stakeholders.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers commended the team for their innovative approaches and provided examples of which aspects of the portfolio were particularly inventive. Specifically, reviewers remarked on DOE's industry challenges, the Green Lease Leaders Program, and CBI's work with communities and districts. While one reviewer commented that CBI had numerous innovative projects, they also noted that not all approaches need to be cutting-edge and that validating and promoting energy efficiency is an important contribution that BTO makes for the industry.</p>
<p>With regards to the impact of CBI's Partnership portfolio, reviewers were complimentary and demonstrated great support for the team's efforts. The majority of reviewers agreed that the portfolio advances the state of the market and noted that it brings early adopters into a position to demonstrate success. One reviewer mentioned that BTO has an even greater influence in areas of the country that do not prioritize energy-efficiency policy. Some of the programs referenced in conjunction with market advancement were industry challenges, Campaigns, and the Green Lease Leaders program.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments on CBI's support for industry and other key stakeholders were positive and most reviewers recognized that there were few gaps in engagement. A reviewer acknowledged that DOE listens to industry when establishing priorities, which they viewed as an important aspect of stakeholder engagement. Some of the reviewers reiterated that workforce development was an area that CBI could further support. The reviewers continued by mentioning that CBI is likely trying to work the relevant stakeholders, but the groups are often difficult to reach and influence. It was also recommended that, to the extent that resources allow, BTO coordinate more directly with state and local governments.</p>
<p>Many reviewers commented that the portfolio contributed significantly to BTO's energy-efficiency goals both directly and indirectly. By supporting the partnership work, one reviewer explained that CBI ""ensures that the path to meeting those goals is commercially feasible and aligned with industry's needs.""

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, most of the reviewers agreed that the barriers and technical challenges identified are real and appropriate for the federal government to address. Many of the barriers have to do with challenges that span across states, across industries, and across various layers of the grid and the building, such as communications protocols to enable building systems and devices to accept (and act on) grid signals, making them unlikely to be addressed by the private sector. Also, transforming the existing building stock to accommodate and enable increased renewable energy is a substantial challenge that will have wide-ranging benefits to all of society, an appropriate challenge for the federal government.</p>
<p>Many reviewers expressed concerns about market adoption as a major barrier. While these topics are incredibly important, transactive controls are so new that it will take a comprehensive plan to penetrate the market at this point. An awareness and outreach campaign may not be premature to include even in the research phase of the subprogram. One reviewer warned to be careful not to counteract what the market wants to do naturally, while another reviewer suggested that important non-technical/market barriers should receive more attention.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the subprogram significantly advances the state-of-the-art (SOA). The subprogram is taking advanced methods into field tests and supporting novel control platforms that are seeking to change how the balance of supply and demand is achieved within our electric grid. Also, grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) are such a forward-leaning area of focus that most work in this space advances the SOA, and controls is an area of immense need.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers were uncertain about the subprogram's support for industry. The extent to which the industry members were participating in R&D (versus providing equipment) was not clear. Despite reviewers' uncertainty about the relationships with industry partners through these projects, some reviewers commented that the subprogram does support the industry, not only in publicity for those who stepped up as key partners, but also in terms of providing solutions to other technology providers.</p>
<p>Several reviewers noted that the projects do not seem like they are part of a cohesive plan. Compared to other subprograms, it did seem like each lab was pursuing common challenges, but it did not seem like there was common thread that made all the work interdependent. One reviewer suggested that there may need to be a concerted effort to bridge gaps between projects and to pull lessons learned and tools developed from one project to the next.</p>
<p>Many reviewers praised the subprogram for being well-positioned and well-coordinated with private-sector organizations. This was clear from the demonstration projects and the partners incorporated. Some of the pilot projects did note private-sector vendors, hardware suppliers, test sites, etc., as being part of the projects. With this being such a new area for BTO, multiple reviewers agreed that it seems like there is a lot of room to grow in this private-sector collaboration and transfer to private sector should receive more attention.</p>
<p>With regards to communication and stakeholder engagement, many reviewers agreed that utilities should be more involved. The subprogram should conduct interviews with utilities about their needs and overall, the projects would benefit from much greater electric utility, DRMS provider, and demand aggregator (both residential and commercial) participation. One reviewer suggested that this subprogram should integrate more with utilities that are explicitly interested in activating grid-enabled controls and potentially even transactive energy in their territories.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that subprogram accomplishments and results appear to be communicated in the proper venues and in a timely fashion. Multiple reviewers agreed that the information provided was very sufficient to give the reader a solid understanding of what is trying to be accomplished through its lab projects, and how they relate back to BTO-wide goals. One reviewer suggested that the results should be presented at more conferences and events as they are available.</p>
<p>Most reviewers were uncertain if there were any progress and impact metrics and tracking methods, since they were not covered in the presentation. Therefore, it was difficult for the reviewers to assess performance based on metrics based on the information provided. Metrics should be clearer, especially financial goals to bring this into the market.</p>
<p>However, reviewers pointed out that some individual projects did define metrics. For example, the PNNL projects do a reasonable job of listing goals and defining success and the sensors and controls (S&C) logic models also describe key outputs such as next-gen prototypes, predictive algorithms, adaptive controls, etc. Using the S&C key outputs as the basis of subprogram metrics, the subprogram does appear to be making progress toward several of the key outputs.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, this&nbsp;project was well-received with multiple reviewers positively commenting on the approach. One reviewer described the study as ""very exciting and important work"" and inquired about the emerging data sources that the team was planning on utilizing with the metered data from the different regions. It was suggested that the team should purchase any new data that becomes available during the project duration and that data should be prioritized over more modeling. Another reviewer recommended that the team address the issues that arise due to lower-quality data and communicate any of those shortcomings in the results. This reviewer also expressed concern about overfitting the models to the existing data and suggested either reserving enough funding to validate the models or comparing the results to ongoing or new studies.</p>
<p>Reviewer&nbsp;comments were generally complimentary about the potential project impact with the&nbsp;one exception being a reviewer&nbsp;who questioned a single use-case. This reviewer was skeptical about the second use-case &ndash; load forecasting and resource planning&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and&nbsp;noted that longer range forecasts are often ""driven by economic growth, assumptions about environmental regulations, and fuel price forecasts."" Half of the reviewers found the project impact to have great value to stakeholders including utilities, researchers, and industry.&nbsp;One&nbsp;reviewer highlighted how future users could evaluate different demand-management controls approaches such as pre-configurations for common strategies.</p>
<p>In addition to approval&nbsp;of the project's&nbsp;progress, reviewers also applauded the team's coordination and collaboration efforts. Reviewers remarked that the project was a great example of coordination between laboratories and mentioned the 65-member advisory group that contains relevant stakeholders from utilities, consultancies, and government organizations. Other recommendations included developing a guide detailing the intended audience and use for each load shape, establishing multiple use-cases for the available data, and the further collaboration with utilities through state and national organizations.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers approved of the Residential Buildings Integration (RBI) Partnerships portfolio, which included presentations on Home Performance with ENERGY STAR, Better Buildings Residential Network, Home Energy Information Accelerator, Zero Energy Ready Home, and Solar Decathlon. The majority of reviewers agreed that the challenges identified by RBI were significant and appropriate for the federal government to address. One challenge that was repeatedly identified was the difficulty of getting information to the relevant groups and organizations. Several reviewers stated that the RBI programs excelled at disseminating information through the various networks and that DOE is best positioned to host national peer exchanges and serve as a resource clearinghouse. One reviewer mentioned this in relation to the Better Buildings Residential Network since DOE's position and reputation enables the team to share lessons learned and keep stakeholders across the country well-informed.</p>
<p>While reviewer comments on the scope and effectiveness of the portfolio were predominantly positive, some reviewers shared recommendations for improvement for the different programs. A handful of reviewers noted that RBI's decision to increase focus and future resources on existing buildings was well-founded and necessary. Workforce development was also specified as a particular challenge for the industry that should be addressed more directly through BTO's program offerings. However, some reviewers applauded Solar Decathlon for its innovative approach that trains the future workforce in energy-efficient design and construction practices as well as increases public awareness of the benefits. One reviewer suggested expanding Solar Decathlon for local competitions and further utilizing the Solar Decathlon brand and platform to garner more media attention.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers agreed that RBI's Partnership portfolio does not ignore any significant barriers, but reviewers stressed that the programs need adequate funding commensurate with both the challenges and the program objectives. Several reviewers commented that the overall effectiveness of some programs was limited due, in part, to the level of resources allocated. Despite the limitations, reviewers complimented the team's efforts to develop a comprehensive portfolio of programs.</p>
<p>Reviewers found that many of the programs within RBI's Partnership portfolio were impacting the industry and advancing the state of the market. Some of the programs that were repeatedly referenced in this regard were Zero Energy Ready Home, Solar Decathlon, and the Home Energy Information Accelerator. The different strategies for the programs were highlighted in terms of how quickly each program could accelerate the market and provide a lasting impact. For example, one reviewer described the Zero Energy Ready Home program as ""pursuing an incremental rather than a disruptive strategy."" The same reviewer continued by explaining that this approach has a better chance of success.</p>
<p>In terms of impact, reviewers were generally in consensus about the team's support for industry and their stakeholder engagement efforts. The majority of reviewers described RBI's portfolio as effective in its partnership with the wider community. Comments varied by specific program in terms of each reviewer's approval of the team's coordination with industry and whether there were gaps in support. One reviewer recommended strengthening BTO's ties with the financial sector and potentially leveraging the expertise in the technology sector. Furthermore, some reviewers mentioned that the RBI Partnership&rsquo;s portfolio could improve its support of residential building owners. However, reviewers also noted that this stakeholder group would be very difficult to engage and influence toward energy-efficient choices and behaviors.</p>
<p>Reviewers were slightly split regarding how effectively the RBI Partnership portfolio contributes to BTO's wider goals. Most reviewer comments indicated that the portfolio successfully achieved energy savings with some programs contributing directly to the goals and others indirectly. However, some of the reviewers stated that they were uncertain to the extent to which the portfolio contributes to BTO's goals because the presentation lacked key information and data. Nevertheless, reviewers agreed that much of the portfolio&rsquo;s impact would not be achieved without BTO investment. A reviewer reiterated this point by stating, ""the market would do little if it were left to its own pressures.""</p>
<p>The team&rsquo;s collaboration, coordination, and integration of the RBI Partnership portfolio was predominantly well-received. Reviewers generally found the portfolio to be integrated as well as coordinated with other relevant efforts in the energy-efficiency community. One reviewer stated, ""the lines of communication seem to be very open at DOE and this collaborative tone ultimately serves to benefit all of our work."" Regional engagement was identified as a potential area of improvement given that each climate zone has unique characteristics and challenges to consider. It was also suggested that better visualization of the interconnections between programs, initiatives, and stakeholder groups can help communities better understand the dynamics of the portfolio.</p>
<p>While the majority of comments on collaboration were encouraging, two reviewers reiterated that there was insufficient data presented on the specific stakeholders involved in each program. The reviewers noted that this absence of information made it difficult to draw conclusions about the level and extent of engagement. Other reviewers highlighted the current portfolio partners and remarked that there may be additional opportunities to effectively leverage new channel partners. It was also recommended to further connect with state and local organizations working in the same space in order to collaborate and share lessons learned.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the barriers are real, significant, and appropriate for DOE and the labs to work on. The barriers and technical challenges identified for adoption of optimized building operation strategies are widespread problems that only can be addressed with a large-scale effort initiated by the federal government. Reviewers were generally in consensus that the major barriers and technical challenges have been adequately identified in the research agenda.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers stressed the importance of technology-specific barriers, such as adoption of existing technology and evolving technology. Examples include use of programmable, learning thermostats in residential homes and building automation systems in small commercial buildings. One reviewer suggested a prioritization of which barrier(s) to address first in order to achieve BTO's targets to help to prioritize funding.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the subprogram advances the state-of-the-art, particularly in controls and benchmarking, and has an opportunity to lead in the emerging area of comfort sensing. This program should be out in front in large part to encourage open-source, interoperable sensors and equipment. However, one reviewer did caution that there may be some challenges, particularly in meeting BTO's long-term energy saving goals, as more ""smart"" systems come online with buildings (both residential and commercial).</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the subprogram is supporting industry and contributing to BTO's energy-savings goals. Industry is involved in several projects through industrial advisory boards and the development of better sensors and controls, particularly related to building-grid interactions and grid harmonization, is critical to the achievement of BTO's energy goals as the grid evolves and as energy codes become more stringent. Reviewers suggested more engagement with building owners and managers who may see the most benefits both from energy savings and from user satisfaction point-of-view and more engagement with private sector partners in deployment, particularly of pilot projects.</p>
<p>Many reviewers described the subprogram as well-integrated, particularly within BTO, EERE, and DOE. It effectively leverages subprogram support and other subprograms. In addition, BTO is clearly integrated within other sectors of DOE. For example, grid-to-building interoperability is part of the portfolio.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the subprogram has good coordination with public organizations and private organizations (through industrial advisory boards), but reviewers did make suggestions for further coordination. It will be key to collaborate with ASHRAE, BACnet, Project Haystack, Brick, etc., as well as with private manufacturers interested in open communications protocols and interoperability to ensure that all technology developed by this program can be commercialized in a way that benefits all players in the market, as well as advances DOE's and BTO's efficiency goals. Also, coordination/collaboration with public and private organizations in sectors outside the energy sector, such as advanced manufacturing and entertainment sectors, would be beneficial.</p>
<p>As for communication and stakeholder engagement, reviewers agreed that this is a strength for the subprogram. The subprogram integrates inputs from national labs, industry, and academia, and the subprogram partners reach out to stakeholders, including building owners, managers, and users. Overall, reviewer consensus was that BTO Sensors and Controls is doing a great job of reaching out, engaging, and communicating with the proper stakeholders (public and private sectors).</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the subprogram had good external communication/publication of results, and reviewers provided many examples of this. BTO does an excellent job of announcing funding opportunities and communicating project status and opportunities (e.g., publications, reports, announcements, etc.). Also, the BTO peer review and Better Buildings Accelerators are excellent ways to bring stakeholders together and communicate success.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the subprogram has the proper progress and impact metrics, as well as methods of tracking them. Furthermore, the subprogram is investing in benchmarking to help validate developed technology and its potential impact. The subprogram meets its energy-savings goals and is the leader in defining occupant-centric measures.</p>
<p>However, reviewers made multiple suggestions for improving the subprogram's metrics. It should be considered to validate the cost and efficiency predictions of SCOPE and to include alternative technologies, as well as those outside the BTO scope, in order to ensure that the developed technologies are ultimately successful in the market. Also, a greater focus on accelerating technology adoption would be welcomed. The program could support this through education, outreach, and tools but also through technology development (e.g., simplification, self-configuration, self-commissioning).</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers had a variety of perspectives on the project&nbsp;as&nbsp;several reviewers&nbsp;commented positively&nbsp;on&nbsp;the new approach for fabricating building envelope material. While the approach was considered intriguing and well-established by two reviewers, a third reviewer expressed doubts about the experimental realization of the project's simulations. The approach was also described as risky, but the reviewer followed up&nbsp;and&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;that the project was appropriately scheduled for only one year. Another reviewer noted that the principal investigators are still uncertain how to accurately measure thermal conductivity for small samples. This was stated multiple times by reviewers as a potential concern as the project progresses.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers were in consensus as to the potential impact of the new building envelope material. Several reviewers remarked that if the project accomplished its goals, it would result in a transformative material that would have a significant impact on energy usage. It is important to note that a few reviewers were skeptical about whether the project team could successfully reach the targeted R-value.</p>
<p>The reviewers were pleased with the project's progress especially with regards to modeling. Two of the five reviewers expressed their hope to see further results. With regards to collaboration, one reviewer approved of the team's internal composition of experts, while several of the other reviewers&nbsp;emphasized&nbsp;the&nbsp;room for improvement with stakeholder engagement as the project moves forward.</p>
<p>Given the early stage of the research, reviewers were concerned whether the team would be able to fabricate a sample material in the remainder of the project term. As previously mentioned, two reviewers reiterated the issue of successfully measuring the low thermal conductivity of a sample.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers&nbsp;acknowledged that&nbsp;the project overcame some barriers to transferring the methodology used to darken sunglasses to windows. Reviewers&nbsp;also&nbsp;noted a number of technical obstacles the project&nbsp;still&nbsp;needs to overcome. Although the data shown indicated electrochromic cycling durability greater than 1 million cycles and also&nbsp; acceptable temperature and physical stress durability,&nbsp;reviewers cited challenges&nbsp;related to durability including problems related to all-plastic&nbsp;construction issues&nbsp;associated with visible transmission;&nbsp;whether glare reduction would be adequate;&nbsp;high solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC) in the dark state;&nbsp;and infrared (IR) blocking.</p>
<p>Some reviewers&nbsp;stated that&nbsp;the project demonstrated the&nbsp;methodology is feasible, but one felt SHCG performance would be poor. Besides the challenges noted above, one reviewer&nbsp;highlighted&nbsp;transparency as another issue to be resolved. Two reviewers&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;concern about whether a retrofit market will be available.&nbsp;One reviewer noted that the project concept appears to be cost-effective and useful for after-market applications. Additionally, this reviewer thought the concept might be applicable to glare reduction on skylights or the non-vision parts of windows. Another reviewer also highlighted the cheaper manufacturing process, while a separate reviewer commented that the project is quite promising with a clear potential impact.</p>
<p>Four of the reviewers judged that the project has progressed toward its project goals. One reviewer&nbsp;commented&nbsp;that applying the methodology to larger size windows would not be feasible due to expenses related to resolving grid lines, although another reviewer stated&nbsp;they&nbsp;had no concerns about grid lines. Reviewers generally felt the project's collaborative efforts are good, but one reviewer felt&nbsp;the project had not obtained clear&nbsp;guidance from industry partners concerning glazing requirements.</p>
<p>Although some reviewers felt the project has some potential for achieving its goals, the number and nature of the challenges as described&nbsp;above affected the score for remaining project work. One reviewer felt it was unclear&nbsp;if&nbsp;the project methodology would translate to sufficient production capability or be feasible. Another reviewer felt that enhancements to the product would be required such that no cost savings would be achieved; product quality would be suboptimal as well.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project approach to develop an adaptive weather-resistant barrier to control moisture levels in building envelopes was generally well-received. Reviewers appreciated the team's project design and remarked on the project's progression from small-scale to building-scale demonstration. One reviewer agreed with the team's decision to pause their technical research to focus on the economics and market potential of the technology. However, a different reviewer expressed concern about the safety of the membranes as they may short-circuit if punctured, but the reviewer continued by noting that the team was&nbsp;accounting for&nbsp;this in the design.</p>
<p>With regards to the project impact, comments varied&nbsp;as some&nbsp;reviewers disagreed&nbsp;on the project's potential to contribute to DOE goals. Several reviewers found the membranes to be an interesting product idea that could extend the life of highly insulating building envelopes. On the other hand, some reviewers noted that the project would not directly reduce energy usage, but instead, it would address the embodied energy in a building. One of these reviewers stressed that the project would add value to buildings and suggested that DOE determine how to quantify the benefits of decreasing embodied energy. In addition, a reviewer described the solution for shedding absorbed water as ""unnecessarily complex"" and proposed applying the technology to other applications.</p>
<p>While reviewers were complimentary of the project's current progress, they emphasized the importance of the building-scale prototype and validating market interest. A couple of reviewers questioned whether the team would finish the remaining work in the allotted time. In addition, the team's collaboration and coordination were highlighted by the majority of reviewers as areas of strength for the project. These reviewers applauded the team's work with Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the partnering private companies. However, one reviewer recommended additional commercialization support that could assist the project team in identifying other applications for the technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers approved of the approach to&nbsp;analyze production costs paired with efforts to increase the R-value of&nbsp;nanoporous&nbsp;polyisocyanurate (PIR), while aiming to both reduce the cost and improve the long-term performance of foam insulation. The freeze-drying approach to making insulation should be able to yield their target&nbsp;nanoporous&nbsp;material morphology. Most reviewers agreed that this is a very well-established approach.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that, if successful, the results of this project could lead to significant improvements in energy efficiency and industry adoption. This project seems like a good path to making a better foam board, and new insulation materials such as this will be critical to reducing building energy use. One reviewer pointed out that this material is not as exotic as some of the other materials presented in this review, but this is a good thing because it means that the time to market can be much quicker in this case.</p>
<p>Most reviewers highlighted that the project has so far achieved an R-value as high as R-10/inch.&nbsp;Significant progress has been made to date, even though it is still lower than the project target of R-12/inch. One reviewer praised the project team for developing and running a cost model to estimate economic feasibility, showing cost-competitiveness with current polyiso&nbsp;insulation, and demonstrating scalable manufacturing processes with successful freeze-drying.</p>
<p>All reviewers praised the project team for their great collaboration, particularly with manufacturers from industry. There are additional key team members from the research community, academia, and industry, and there is good collaboration between the members of the project team, which is impressive considering that various institutions are involved and that the principal investigator has been recently changed. One reviewer was impressed with the collaboration to produce potential commercialization pathways and great intel on actual costs at-scale, while another reviewer praised the team's close work with companies to conduct their techno-economic analysis.</p>
<p>Many reviewers expressed concern about whether they will be able to get to R-12/inch by the time the project is completed. It is unclear whether the project team will be able to achieve the targeted R-value level for the insulating samples and test their long-term performance without significantly affecting the production costs. Other reviewers agreed that the remaining work will meet the project-specific goals, stating that it appropriately focuses on continued optimization of material synthesis and processing, it can be completed within the established timeframe, and it seems much closer to market than some of the other projects.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, the reviewers approved of the project approach and recognized that the team has done well in identifying the relevant risks. The team anticipated possible difficulties and has sound plans to overcome them. Two reviewers expressed concerns about developing a prototype that can last more than 10 years of operation, since the concentrators are made of acrylic materials.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the project will reduce energy use and lighting costs. However, two reviewers recognized that there are some major barriers to adoption. A building owner would have to buy this system in addition to a traditional lighting system since it does not produce light at night and this could be a&nbsp;significant hindrance&nbsp;to market adoption.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the project is showing good progress, despite some minor delays.&nbsp;This project is about 2.5 years into a 3.5-year timeline and many of the key risks were mitigated. One reviewer described the progress, stating that an integrated motor platform was developed, the panel sealing process was created, which survived thermal cycling, and the tests of the panel at nine different incidence angles and five different temperatures were satisfactory.</p>
<p>The reviewers generally praised the project's collaboration and coordination, particularly with lighting designers and industry experts. The feedback from industry was incorporated into design iterations. All the steps required major coordination from team members, and it seems as though all are working fine.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the remaining project work is appropriate for this stage in the project. Their plan for the remaining period of time is reasonable and the data from field installation will be invaluable. However, one reviewer highlighted that the principal investigator did not provide a plan to catch up or ask for an extension, but building interface and operational demonstration are still not finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers were divided on their opinions of the project approach. Many reviewers expressed concerns about the project's ability to attain the very low thermal conductivity targets of this program. There are still many questions that need to be answered and it is unclear whether the presented approach will lead to the proposed outcomes. However, some reviewers praised the project&nbsp;and&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that the group is working to develop an insulating material with high mechanical strength, which could allow reducing thermal bridging through structural materials. If all claims are true regarding strength and insulation value, it&nbsp;was touted as&nbsp;a potentially exciting new product.</p>
<p>Reviewers&nbsp;also&nbsp;provided mixed opinions of the project's impact. Many reviewers highlighted the project's potential for reducing thermal bridging and possible appeal in the market as a ""green"" product. While it may ultimately be a niche product, it does have the potential to be a new building material with unique properties compared to standard building materials. However, one reviewer pointed out that the project could contribute to the program goals if it were to be successful, but the success of this project, as presented, is uncertain.</p>
<p>Overall, most reviewers agreed that the project has made significant progress, but additional efforts are needed to reach the target thermal conductivity. The team has demonstrated progress in hydrophobicity coatings, improvement in mechanical performance, and improvement in thermal performance, but the thermal properties of the material must be verified by an independent party. One reviewer critiqued the team by emphasizing that&nbsp;if the goal was to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;very low thermal conductivity, they should have spent more time on that part of the project.</p>
<p>Many reviewers praised the project's collaboration and coordination, particularly their work with potential customers of the product. This project is engaging stakeholders, but not necessarily building insulation stakeholders, so one reviewer suggested taking advantage of the structural properties of the material and using it for window frames, door frames, and other structural components that need to be better insulating. Another reviewer commented that it was not clear from the presentation how the various members of the team were interacting.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the project seems on track, with remaining work focusing on continued process development and exploration of manufacturing processes and market opportunities. One reviewer recommended the project team get third-party verification of both thermal properties and mechanical strength.</p>
<p>Many reviewers agreed that the concept is interesting with unique material properties. Multiple reviewers commented on the strength of having low-cost and wood-based coatings that are both structural and highly insulating. Different applications for the project were noted, including new construction, retrofits, flowing and window framing. One reviewer found that the use of natural wood could be viewed as both a strength and weakness of the project, depending on carbon intensity and environmental impact of treating the wood, and the balance of wood harvesting and planting new trees.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>Reviewer feedback was critical of the potential to achieve the thermal conductivity goals within the stated project timeline. The project team also acknowledged that the original thermal conductivity target was overly aggressive and hence relaxed that requirement during the course of the project (new target: 0.012 W/m-K). Moving forward, this project was selected for a Phase II SBIR funding award and as a result, the project timeline will be extended to help achieve new goals.</p>",R&D - Building Envelope

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers praised the triple pane insulating glass unit (IGU) approach.&nbsp;Reviewers agreed that the Core Windows Research &amp; Development&nbsp;work is based on a solid background of existing&nbsp;research&nbsp;and utilization of current technology for thin glass beyond televisions.&nbsp;Reviewers noted that the&nbsp;approach to characterize and evaluate energy-saving window technologies&nbsp;is&nbsp;incredibly comprehensive and analytical. One reviewer highlighted that the largest hurdle may be thin glass manufacturing and handling.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that this project provides tools, methods, and analysis of advanced window technologies to guide materials/product developers and window manufacturers to optimum performance products, although it is not focused on new window technologies. Based on initial assumptions, the impact of this project as modelled is tremendous, and&nbsp;two&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;singled out&nbsp;the importance of the Foundational Design Research Aid (FDRA) project as crucial and something most technical subjects lack, adding that the project has merit and should be continued.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;reviewer&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;uncertainty over&nbsp;the&nbsp;impact of the&nbsp;FDRA&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers did not find any concerns with the project's progress to date.&nbsp;Reviewers mentioned that the team has&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;good early results in all four areas, with the triple pane IGU having made most progress and the educational videos at the earliest stage, and it has been many years of focused development and continuous improvement of window materials, technologies, evaluation, and testing techniques and tools.&nbsp;On the other hand, reviewers were somewhat split as to the extent to which the&nbsp;FDRA&nbsp;project has demonstrated&nbsp;contribution to the project-specific goals.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the team is working on collaborative projects. Regarding the FDRA project, some&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;additional collaboration with organizations such as additional universities with window projects, existing ARPA-E projects (such as&nbsp;SHIELD), NFRC, AAMA, WDMA, and IWFA. There is excellent diversity of stakeholders to reach out to and identify. One reviewer suggested diversifying collaborators on the educational/training videos to include manufacturers, R&amp;D, and engineering functions.</p>
<p>Overall, many reviewers praised the forward-looking analysis and the future work planned for all projects. Reviewers commented that&nbsp;everything appears to be in line, and&nbsp;noted that&nbsp;the researchers should continue to support updating and education of product developers in understanding basic window performance technologies and features.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, the reviewers approved of this approach to deliver an insulating material at a low cost with a decreased thermal conductivity. The material design approach, which aims to develop insulation with thermal properties like aerogels, while avoiding the requirement for supercritical drying, is based on a strong theoretical framework and would significantly reduce costs. Reviewers&nbsp;emphasized that&nbsp;a better understanding of the interfacial heat transport of nanoparticles or in nanocomposites as it applies to building insulation systems would be beneficial. They also noted&nbsp;that&nbsp;risk mitigation strategies did not appear to be discussed.</p>
<p>Many reviewers agreed that the biggest remaining challenge for this project is reaching the R-value target (R-12/inch) with acceptable production costs. Most reviewers also praised the project's potential impact&nbsp;and&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that significant gains in thermal insulation performance will reduce energy use in buildings in large scale and it is possible that the new insulation could replace a part of the share of the current building insulation market. Using the properties of two solids in contact and tuning them to yield better performance than either material on its own is a good concept and if the approach works, it would enable much lower cost insulation materials with properties like aerogel.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the team has made good progress with reducing the thermal conductivity to R-9/inch, despite facing several setbacks. It is exciting to have both a rigid and flexible material already manufactured, but as one reviewer pointed out, this project&nbsp;was&nbsp;sidetracked/delayed by the difficulty in measuring small sample sizes with high R-values. Another reviewer highlighted that significant challenges remain and are not clearly outlined to reach the targets set for the project in terms of R-value and cost.</p>
<p>Many reviewers praised the project's collaboration and coordination, particularly their work with the industry advisory board. The project seems to have good industry partners, but it&nbsp;is unclear whether there are partners to manufacture the product. One reviewer expressed concern that the&nbsp;project&nbsp;team has&nbsp;obtained&nbsp;adequate input from relevant industry representatives (i.e., insulation companies) throughout the project.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the remaining work will focus on improving the thermal conductivity from R-10/inch to the target of R-12/inch. The remaining work seems on track, with a good combination of ideas to pursue higher R/inch values toward&nbsp;R-12, and they have a variety of parameters they can vary to try and reach this target in the remaining eight months of the project. One reviewer highly recommended a more-detailed description of the remaining project challenges as well as of the production costs expected for the material.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers expressed some concerns regarding the project approach. While two reviewers praised the project's comprehensive literature review&nbsp;and three reviewers&nbsp;felt the team had&nbsp;provided an&nbsp;adequate and clear&nbsp;approach, most reviewers questioned the project's level of detail. These reviewers stated&nbsp;the project should have more information about simulations and controls; validation efforts&nbsp;are not included; researchers did not compare their results to previous studies; information about optimization is lacking; and&nbsp;EnergyPlus&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;sufficient&nbsp;to&nbsp;meet the project goals.</p>
<p>All reviewers but one indicated the project could have some impact, and three reviewers made positive remarks about the&nbsp;project's alignment with BTO&nbsp;goals and the project's potential impact&nbsp;overall.&nbsp;One reviewer felt the project impact would be limited because similar and more comprehensive analyses have already been completed.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewer comments were split regarding the approach to the ultralow thermal conductivity material project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Many of the reviewers found the team's approach to be practical and considerate with a step-by-step path toward a high-conductivity material. One reviewer appreciated the team's use of hollow silica spheres as the base material for the insulation but noted the importance of solving the issue around particle aggregation. Some uncertainty remained around which model the project was using to predict the presented performance and whether each of the steps would achieve the stated reduction in thermal conductivity.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers were very positive about the potential impact of the project to contribute to DOE's goals of reducing energy use in new and existing buildings. One reviewer stated that ""a low-cost, high R-value insulation would certainly have a strong impact on energy efficiency."" That same reviewer noted their concern about whether this particular project would be able to produce the material at the cost or performance proposed. A different reviewer remarked that even if the project did not reach the intended goal, the knowledge gained during the research would contribute to achieving an ultralow thermal conductivity material in the future.</p>
<p>Overall, the team's progress was applauded, and the initial materials were described as ""promising"" with ""impressive uniform hollow spheres."" A reviewer commented positively on the team's progress with particle formation as well as low thermal conductivity particle linkers and polymer coatings. While reviewers approved of the project progress in the laboratory, they viewed the collaboration efforts outside of ORNL as lacking. Several reviewers provided the suggestion to engage with relevant industry manufacturers and installers earlier in the process. However, some reviewers disagreed with that evaluation and referenced the early stage of the technology as reason for not engaging further at this point in the project.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewer comments were divided on the anisotropic thermal management for building envelopes project with reviewers disagreeing on the study's approach. One reviewer expressed excitement for the project and detailed the parts in the approach that would lead to the team overcoming technical barriers. However, several reviewers identified challenges that the team would likely face including control requirements, long-term performance, and the overall cost of the technology. There was a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the project details&nbsp;as&nbsp;reviewers asked&nbsp;for clarification on the heat sink in particular. Also, a reviewer was concerned that the technology might not function as expected in a real-world scenario with full weather conditions and multiple seasons.</p>
<p>The project's contribution toward DOE goals was similarly questioned by the majority of reviewers. While many of the reviewers reiterated their concerns, one reviewer applauded the project, stating that it would ""become the foundation for future studies that pursue this research direction."" The reviewer explained that by achieving sufficient thermal anisotropy, the technology should improve the building envelope resulting in energy savings. On the other hand, several reviewers were unsure whether the technology, if successfully developed, would achieve widescale adoption. A reviewer was uncertain how the thermally anisotropic composites (TACs) would differ from the application of ventilated cladding. The impact presented was also disputed as it was based solely on summer applications, which would result in a reduced whole building estimate.</p>
<p>In terms of the team's efforts to meet their goals, multiple reviewers noted the good progress made in the first six months of the project. Some of the completed work included a simulation tool, a bench experiment, and a chamber experiment that led to results showing reduced heat transfer to the interior of the building during the summer months. One reviewer mentioned that the presentation failed to discuss the challenges of using a TAC system compared to traditional building insulations,&nbsp;such as the controls needed, manufacturing&nbsp;costs,&nbsp;and installation costs.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers were split on the team's collaboration efforts with comments ranging from outstanding to poor and in need of improvement. The team's technical expertise was repeatedly cited as a project strength and their outreach to key organizations was commended. However, reviewers recommended engaging further with external stakeholders and developing industry partnerships to provide feedback on installing and operating the TAC system.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewer comments on the project were very positive, with reviewers describing the approach as clear and consistent with current needs. Several reviewers noted the limitations of standard thermal measurement approaches, which require a large sample size, and explained how the project would address these barriers. The strategy to work directly with manufacturers to adjust existing testing equipment was mentioned multiple times. Reviewers appreciated this approach compared to the alternative of proposing a new set of apparatus to test thermal conductivity. However, one reviewer remarked that some of the tests that were planned by the team seem unnecessary as the results are somewhat self-evident.</p>
<p>The potential impact of the project was similarly well-received due to the clear need that this study would address in the research community. Reviewers commented that the new technique would not only significantly facilitate material development but would also provide a more accurate method to test very low thermal conductivity samples. One reviewer followed&nbsp;up and stated&nbsp;that by developing a method and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard material, the team could help reduce variability in results. Overall, the project's alignment with DOE goals to create a material with a very high R-value per inch was celebrated.</p>
<p>While the project is still in its early stages, the team's progress as presented was equally acclaimed by reviewers, who complimented the group's preliminary testing. The reviewers noted the work the team completed in order to identify shortcomings in the current apparatus and then down-select from their initial test methods. It was recommended that the project include test samples with R-values that exceed 10 per inch since the industry is progressing toward very low thermal conductivity materials. In addition, a reviewer highlighted the challenge of making the surroundings for the test sample so that the results are consistent and accurate.</p>
<p>In terms of collaboration and coordination, reviewers found the project team was appropriately engaging in stakeholder engagement efforts. The team's partnership with NIST, as well as other key stakeholders like thermal instrumentation manufacturers, researchers, and ASTM, was commended for its inclusivity. Several reviewers also specifically mentioned the project consortium in relation to the team's collaboration plan.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewer comments were split with regards to the projects, which include (1) polymeric vacuum insulation spheres and (2) coated and evacuated insulation spheres. While the two individual projects were well-received by most of the reviewers, some expressed concern about the team's approach. One reviewer noted the challenge of maintaining vacuum in a polymeric closed cell for extended periods of time, and a second reviewer questioned whether the team had a clear strategy to optimize the performance of the spheres. On the other hand, several reviewers complimented the team's concept, range of techniques, and two test methods&mdash;air assisted and mechanical chopping.</p>
<p>Overall, many reviewers approved of the potential impact the evacuated spheres project could have on DOE building energy-efficiency goals. The contribution of the new technology, if successfully developed, was characterized as hugely impactful since a cost-effective, high R-value product would increase deployment of advanced insulation. Reviewers mentioned the great potential for the reduction in energy use and predicted that the closed cell vacuum insulation would be well-accepted by the construction community. However, a sole reviewer described the impact as limited due to a lack of discussion around technology production costs. The reviewer continued&nbsp;and explained&nbsp;that if cost remained high, market adoption would be constrained, especially since the team did not demonstrate the proposed target R-value.</p>
<p>In terms of project progress, reviewers disagreed as to the extent to which the team had accomplished their project-specific goals. Based on the presentation, several reviewers commended the team's previous work and, in particular, their progress with the mechanical chopping method. Other reviewers remarked on the good progress but were uncertain whether the team's future goals would be attained in the time remaining. The challenge to ensure durability and stability for long-term performance was also noted.</p>
<p>The team's collaboration and coordination efforts were generally well-regarded for the very early stage of the project. While reviewers indicated that the team identified potential future industrial partners, some other reviewers stated that the industry involved could be ""actively strengthened."" These reviewers suggested that increased industry partnership would provide valuable insights on cost and any production challenges.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Multiple reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that the project has a good approach, with one noting how characterization and modeling will guide material design, while another highlighted the approach of using molecular dynamics&nbsp;(MD)&nbsp;simulations and XDR as a function of cycling.&nbsp;Another noted that the team has already surveyed available&nbsp;phase change materials (PCMs)&nbsp;and determined candidates to further study,&nbsp;and one reviewer questioned if there is a more efficient way to pick design alternatives.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;cautioned&nbsp;that a problem with salt hydrate&nbsp;PCMs&nbsp;is supercooling, and two reviewers&nbsp;recommended focusing&nbsp;more on phase separation and supercooling.&nbsp;One reviewer thought that the description of the approach to develop the low cost PCMs is unclear.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;reviewer&nbsp;found&nbsp;that the connection between the molecular modeling and material design should be more explicit.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that if this project can achieve its goals, it will have a significant impact.&nbsp;They noted the impact of low-cost PCMs is significant for enhancing the thermal performance of buildings, including integration within building envelope systems, as well as&nbsp;heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and cooling (HVAC)&nbsp;systems. The PCMs will provide thermal alternatives to electric storage that could be significantly cheaper and seamlessly integrated within the building systems. A few reviewers pointed to significant energy use reduction of the technology. Others highlighted the&nbsp;cost&nbsp;barrier&nbsp;in&nbsp;industry&nbsp;and mentioned&nbsp;that this technology could change the PCM industry if cost goals are met.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;was impressed&nbsp;that this project could be less expensive than Tesla's and LG's technologies with comparable life spans.</p>
<p>The majority of reviewers&nbsp;found&nbsp;that progress to date is reasonable for the time period, as the project is still in its early stages. However, one reviewer commented that little progress has been made so far in these early stages. A couple&nbsp;of&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;remarked&nbsp;that the outcomes and purpose of MD simulation analysis are not clearly defined&nbsp;but a&nbsp;few&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;were pleased&nbsp;that the team already had test results on composites.&nbsp;One reviewer commented that preliminary degradation studies look problematic&nbsp;but the majority of reviewers commented that the remaining work for the project seems reasonable in the timeframe remaining. However, two reviewers pointed out that remaining tasks&nbsp;should be more clearly described and defined.</p>
<p>The majority of reviewers agreed that the team has solid coordination and collaboration. Multiple reviewers highlighted the multidisciplinary team with expertise that&nbsp;aligns with the important areas of the project, such as HVAC and thermal storage companies and graphite suppliers. One reviewer commented that the team has good early engagement with industry, while others&nbsp;recommended that&nbsp;the involvement of industry partners&nbsp;should&nbsp;be strengthened. One reviewer&nbsp;applauded&nbsp;the&nbsp;team's&nbsp;well-known track record of working&nbsp;well&nbsp;together.&nbsp;However, another&nbsp;reviewer commented that it is unclear how the building energy modeling component of the project is represented in the project team's expertise.</p>
<p>A few reviewers highlighted the concept of combining graphite with hydrated salts.&nbsp;However, another&nbsp;warned&nbsp;that it is unclear that graphite can address all of the shortcomings of salt hydrates (incongruent melting, large supercooling, low thermal conductivity, corrosion, etc.).&nbsp;One reviewer suggested the project team consider adding other salt hydrates as candidates, as the different combinations with graphite may offer alternative solutions.</p>
<p>One reviewer&nbsp;applauded this project for&nbsp;taking a much more scientific approach to creating better&nbsp;PCM&nbsp;composites than other comparable projects. One reviewer&nbsp;approved of&nbsp;the strong capabilities to test many samples at a time.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;the team look into active ways to avoid segregation in addition to the passive ones already being investigated.&nbsp;One reviewer suggested&nbsp;adding cycles as a parameter to make comparisons between different PCMs.&nbsp;Another reviewer noted the team should concentrate on the chemistry of the PCM and have the&nbsp;final product evaluated in several places with different climates.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>A few reviewers&nbsp;commented positively&nbsp;and noted that this&nbsp;is needed in industry&nbsp;and&nbsp;will aid in the development of new materials&nbsp;and address a knowledge gap&nbsp;on subcontinuum thermal transport in amorphous materials and research on interfacial thermal&nbsp;resistance.&nbsp;However, multiple reviewers&nbsp;expressed concern about&nbsp;the inherent difficulty in modeling subcontinuum thermal transport.&nbsp;Many reviewers noted that while ambitious, the project approach is very general and not sufficiently focused. They&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that it is unclear what the model will capture, what materials will be considered, accuracy levels desired, the input parameters required, limitations of the models, and which morphology possibilities will be available. One reviewer commented that the team will likely need to rely on empirical modeling due to the difficulty of properly incorporating&nbsp;nanoscale heat transfer effects through physics-based models, while another pointed out that the number of effects and variables the project is attempting to capture in a unified model are too broad. A reviewer suggested that defining the scope only on the characterization of materials may be more beneficial than&nbsp;building the model, as the model will not&nbsp;provide significant results&nbsp;if it cannot be calibrated.</p>
<p>Reviewers provided multiple recommendations to the project team, and&nbsp;one&nbsp;noted that&nbsp;the project focuses&nbsp;on foam-like materials and&nbsp;asked&nbsp;if the model could be applied to fibrous systems. Another suggested that in addition to steady state, the team should look into possible non-steady state capabilities of the model. One reviewer commented on the importance of&nbsp;providing well-defined instructions on how to use the model and&nbsp;clearly outlining if and how the models can be flexible to be used to develop and assess properties of other materials with no empirical data.&nbsp;Another reviewer encouraged the team to focus on sensitivity to key design variables and uncertainties rather than the accuracy of the final conductivity prediction. One reviewer recommended considering motion of molecules when dealing with interface heat transfer.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers commented that the project could&nbsp;be hugely valuable in the design&nbsp;and development&nbsp;of new insulation materials.&nbsp;Many reviewers agreed that the primary strength of this project is the development of reference models that can be valuable to improve the design optimization of highly insulating materials for building envelope systems.&nbsp;One reviewer noted that developing models does not directly deliver energy savings, but that models are needed to create&nbsp;new insulation systems that may deliver energy savings.&nbsp;One reviewer pointed out that if the project can characterize the materials to calibrate the model, it will be quite useful. A reviewer critiqued&nbsp;that the project presentation did not provide impact information.&nbsp;Two reviewers&nbsp;expressed concern that&nbsp;they were unclear how useful the model will be, questioning the validity of a quantitative model for materials development, as well as the flexibility of the model.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the team has&nbsp;made progress building pieces of the model and running simulations, but two reviewers&nbsp;suggested that better definition of the project&nbsp;scope is required. One reviewer&nbsp;remarked&nbsp;that the project plans to incorporate&nbsp;nanoscale effects will take longer than planned, so the project timeline should be adjusted accordingly.&nbsp;A couple of reviewers noted that challenges&nbsp;remain&nbsp;to completing model calibration and sensitivity analysis.&nbsp;One reviewer flagged the limited data available for the model&nbsp;as a potential issue.</p>
<p>Many reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that the project team has&nbsp;extensive collaboration through a strong&nbsp;advisory board of thermal transport researchers and the materials development field. One reviewer commented that the project team is engaging a good portion of the research community who would be the users of the modeling tool. Another reviewer&nbsp;flagged&nbsp;that it appeared most of the collaborators are members of universities and/or research labs. This reviewer recommended seeking input from industry stakeholders that may provide valuable feedback of the required capabilities of the models as well as possibly provide additional data.</p>
<p>A couple reviewers were&nbsp;concerned about completing the project within the current timeframe. Many of the reviewers&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that project work is logically planned and progressing well. A few reviewers raised concerns&nbsp;regarding materials characterization for model calibration, noting that it&nbsp;will prove challenging, especially within the timeframe planned. One reviewer cautioned&nbsp;that this project will be an incremental step forward, not a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art insulation materials.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers approved of the approach to the two Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) projects: (1) Ultra High R per inch Vacuum Insulated Panel (VIP) with Developmental Core Material and (2) Self-Healing Films to Improve Durability of VIPs. The projects were described as well-thought-out, methodical, and consistent with both project-level and program-level goals. One reviewer highlighted the importance of long-term performance studies and applauded the team's emphasis on manufacturing and scaling up the technology. The puncture tolerance and durability of VIPs were two challenges that several reviewers mentioned would be addressed during the duration of the projects. A reviewer continued&nbsp;and stated&nbsp;that, if successful, the development of self-healing VIPs films could lead to a ""much larger wide-scale adoption of VIP panels.""</p>
<p>With regards to project impact, reviewers agreed that the studies had the potential to significantly contribute to reducing energy use in buildings. The application of the technology's use in retrofitting buildings was stressed as particularly beneficial in terms of energy savings. The majority of reviewers emphasized the impact that the projects could have on VIPs as a building envelope technology. The opportunity to increase the performance and market adoption was described as ""transformative in the area of insulation.""</p>
<p>In terms of the team's progress, reviewers applauded the projects' preliminary work and their planned activities. Some of the specific progress included the development of a low-cost polymer fiber core, a retrofit demonstration on the R25 boards, and testing of self-healing method using epoxy chemistries. In addition, reviewers reiterated the importance of addressing the remaining challenges related to long-term performance, cost-effectiveness, and durability of both project materials.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments on the team's collaboration and coordination efforts were overwhelmingly positive with five of the reviewers rating the section as ""Outstanding."" Several reviewers referenced the added value of partnering with industry including material manufactures of both VIPs and traditional building insulation. However, it was recommended by two reviewers that the team accelerate their collaboration surrounding the self-healing films project.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers agreed the project approach is solid and could result in a novel window vacuum insulated glazing (VIG) manufacturing process.&nbsp;One reviewer specifically mentioned the&nbsp;ultrasonic welding&nbsp;technique as promising, and three reviewers specifically mentioned the whisker pillars. One reviewer&nbsp;also&nbsp;noted the flexible seal needs to be tested on larger sample sizes.</p>
<p>The reviewers agreed the project could contribute to BTO's energy reduction goals, given the size of the residential windows market and the importance of VIG to high-R windows.&nbsp;The reviewers noted that the project needs to demonstrate the window's market aesthetics will be acceptable; that the success of the welding system is critical and needs to be proven cost-effective and that weld seals will be durable; and that thermal transmittance has not yet been tested.&nbsp;Given these challenges, the reviewers felt that while the project is progressing toward its goals, it still needs to demonstrate some of the key innovations.</p>
<p>The reviewers felt overall that the project's collaboration efforts are good&nbsp;and that team members have expertise. Two&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;felt&nbsp;industrial or&nbsp;manufacturing companies&nbsp;could be involved more in the project&nbsp;while one reviewer&nbsp;questioned&nbsp;why the project is&nbsp;deemed as&nbsp;""too early"" for venture capitalists&nbsp;to consider.</p>
<p>As for the remaining project work, the reviewers felt progress toward goals is being made and the project work is well-planned. However, they noted, as they did in their remarks about the project's impacts, that&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;manufacturing process issues have been identified and need to be addressed.&nbsp;Two reviewers noted the presenter was not the technical lead, and thus some questions about these issues were not answered.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer&nbsp;Comments</h4>
<p>Several&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;were&nbsp;supportive of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Dynamic Reverse Plating&nbsp;project&nbsp;and noted that the approach&nbsp;was following good&nbsp;experimental concepts. One review&nbsp;was&nbsp;complimentary of the team's&nbsp;coordination&nbsp;with&nbsp;industry&nbsp;and other&nbsp;stakeholders.&nbsp;On the other hand,&nbsp;some&nbsp;reviewers expressed concerns about how some technical issues&nbsp;were&nbsp;being addressed. These reviewers felt there should be more of a focus on a systems approach; that the project might not be scalable; that the use of perchloric acid was not an&nbsp;optimal choice&nbsp;environmentally&nbsp;or economically;&nbsp;and that the project would not result in a significant improvement over existing electrochromic&nbsp;(EC)&nbsp;windows.</p>
<p>The reviewers were&nbsp;generally positive about the project's potential impact and&nbsp;contribution&nbsp;to program goals. Reviewers&nbsp;commented on&nbsp;the product's&nbsp;low&nbsp;solar heat gain&nbsp;and&nbsp;highlighted that&nbsp;it could achieve 20% energy savings with long term use.&nbsp;A reviewer also remarked that if the technology successfully works for large size samples, it would make an impact in the market.&nbsp;However, reviewers also noted the high amount of energy needed to manufacture the product&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;the product&nbsp;may&nbsp;not perform better than existing EC windows.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers found the project&nbsp;to be on track to meet project-specific&nbsp;goals.&nbsp;While several&nbsp;reviewers approved of the team's&nbsp;approach to future tasks, one reviewer felt some fundamental issues had not been&nbsp;properly&nbsp;assessed or planned.&nbsp;As for the project's collaborative efforts, one reviewer&nbsp;praised&nbsp;the project&nbsp;for its&nbsp;excellent collaboration with relevant stakeholders.&nbsp;Other&nbsp;reviewers&nbsp;noted that there&nbsp;was room for&nbsp;improvement with regards&nbsp;to participation from&nbsp;industry and&nbsp;coordination with&nbsp;stakeholders.</p>
<p>In terms of&nbsp;project goals, reviewers were split as to whether the project is on track to meet its&nbsp;objectives. Some reviewers felt the project approach and plan are on track, with one reviewer noting the project team manages developments related to materials well. Other reviewers felt that it&nbsp;was&nbsp;not clear how the proposed technology could&nbsp;be leveraged to make a large window, and that significant and challenging project work remains.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Although reviewers found the topic of identifying a refrigerant with low flammability worthy&nbsp;of investigation, many questioned&nbsp;the project's approach. Two reviewers commented that the approach was not clearly identified in the presentation, or that it provided little detail. Two other reviewers expressed concern with the number of variables the team needs to investigate, and&nbsp;added it was unclear&nbsp;if the project contributes to solving technical challenges.</p>
<p>Reviewers were conflicted on the potential impact of the project. While some noted the potential impact for clean and safe refrigerants that could potentially reduce GWP was high, others raised the point that reduced greenhouse gas emissions does not drive toward energy-efficiency program goals.</p>
<p>The presenter needs to clearly articulate how the team is interacting with key stakeholders beyond Trane, two reviewers commented. Another reviewer noted that the project team should focus on engagement with real-life technicians in the field. Although reviewers found the project to be on schedule, many reviewers made recommendations for refocusing the remaining work. These recommendations include further stakeholder involvement, increased field testing, and focus on the long-term effects of the additives. Other recommendations reviewers made were to perform tests under more real-world fire situations, and to complete a more realistic impact of the fully GHG impact of the new refrigerant.</p>
<p>Across the whole project, reviewers applauded the team's excellent credentials, the clear approach, and focus on a problem that could be a leap forward for the next generation of low GWP refrigerants.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers generally found the approach for evaluating the flammability of refrigerants to be valid and well-defined, and noted that using the burning velocity of flammable refrigerants is a good metric for evaluation. Two reviewers commented&nbsp;that this approach and the end product of the research will address an important barrier to adoption of low global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants. The reviewers also appreciated the project's combination of experimental and modeling techniques,&nbsp;and&nbsp;applauded&nbsp;the prediction tools for minimizing flammability that&nbsp;are&nbsp;being developed. Although most reviewers&nbsp;commended&nbsp;the project's approach, one reviewer identified the need for more clarity regarding the testing of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) and&nbsp;hydrofluoro-olefin&nbsp;(HFO)&nbsp;blends.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that, if successfully&nbsp;validated, this project and predictive tool would have a large impact in assessing the flammability of refrigerant blends, especially as the industry works to replace GWP refrigerants. Two reviewers made suggestions&nbsp;for&nbsp;areas of continued study that would improve the project's impact&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;including the effects of humidity and oil, and including a correlation to minimum ignition energy.</p>
<p>The project is making strong progress and is reaching its accomplishments well, reviewers found. As the project continues, reviewers&nbsp;were pleased with the path toward completion, commenting that the remaining work is&nbsp;well-defined&nbsp;and on schedule. One reviewer again noted that the future work does not indicate testing of HFC/HFO blends. Generally, the reviewers found the project team to be highly diverse and capable, with top industry experts from many relevant organizations. One reviewer&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;continued stakeholder engagement, particularly with industry.</p>
<p>The most prominent strength of the project that the reviewers identified was the strong expertise of the project team, led by a NIST researcher with a well-thought-out and well-executed project plan. However, a few reviewers did note areas needing improvement. One reviewer commented that&nbsp;the project had limited refrigerants for the experimental testing,&nbsp;while having a wide range of the refrigerants in the modeling task. Another reviewer suggested&nbsp;expanding the project scope&nbsp;to include the prediction of minimum ignition energy and the heat of combustion, while a third reviewer reiterated&nbsp;the need for more data on the effects of humidity and oil.</p>
<p>As the project continues, the reviewers recommended&nbsp;adding accuracy analysis for the experimental portion, and showing the experimental results with error bars to capture the noise of the measured data.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers found the project's aim to develop a new commercial scale dryer using&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural gas boiler and an ejector technology a promising approach and a good concept. One reviewer questioned&nbsp;the practicality of using ejector technology in commercial locations, with the associated challenges of size and noise, and recommended an implementation plan to address these challenges.</p>
<p>Reviewers were split on the value of the project's impact, with some commenting that, if successful, the technology could greatly contribute to DOE objectives and have an impact beyond the&nbsp;commercial&nbsp;clothes drying market. Half of the reviewers, however, expressed concern&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;technology&nbsp;adoption. Up to this point, the project has progressed well, with promising preliminary data and technical feasibility making the project worthy of continuation, reviewers found. One reviewer cautioned&nbsp;the project team&nbsp;may encounter&nbsp;challenges in field deployment.</p>
<p>Although the project is in its early stages, reviewers were pleased with the linkages made with potential stakeholders, adopters, and manufacturers. The reviewers recommended&nbsp;that the project team include more industry experts and add experts to study potential structural and safety issues.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers were pleased with the remaining project work&nbsp;and&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;the future phases will be the most challenging, and therefore PIs should allot more time&nbsp;to those activities accordingly. The reviewers highlighted the project's sound technical concepts that could readily be adopted if successful.</p>
<p>However, market acceptability is one of the noted project weaknesses. Two other notes of caution moving forward were made:&nbsp;one reviewer recommended purchasing components that are already commercially available, and&nbsp;another reviewer questioned&nbsp;if the project team is adequately considering the impact of the 12&nbsp;pound-force per square inch&nbsp;(psi)&nbsp;vacuum on a large container. To address some of these challenges, reviewers recommended defining specific market requirements for large-scale deployment of commercial drying systems, and leveraging the expertise of a dryer manufacturer to determine if this design is functional, manufacturable, and cost-competitive.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project approach of developing adhesives with specific chemistries for bonding to&nbsp;aluminum and copper is well-thought-out, reviewers commented. One reviewer applauded&nbsp;the team's clear outline and engagement with major manufacturers. Most reviewers found this project to have a huge potential impact on the industry, reducing costs and refrigerant leakage. One reviewer, however, found the project team did not clearly analyze the project impact&nbsp;and&nbsp;noted&nbsp;the team will need to quantify reduction of direct emission of refrigerants.</p>
<p>Although the project was delayed, reviewers commented that the team had made good progress, with a clear plan outlined for development and evaluation of concept.&nbsp;Reviewers observed&nbsp;strong collaboration with adhesive manufacturers and partners at Purdue University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. One reviewer noted&nbsp;the project team should explore more partnerships with coil manufacturers.</p>
<p>Many reviewers expressed concern for the remaining project work, noting extensive work needing to be done to prove quality, reliability, cost, and life-cycle&nbsp;assessment. A particular concern for one reviewer&nbsp;was how the technology will be introduced, as it will require substantial change in production. A reviewer recommended&nbsp;incorporating a plan for support to help manufacturers implement the technology into production to address this challenge. More technically, another reviewer&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;adding sever testing at high temperatures and high pressure under vibration testing, and compatibility with refrigerant and oil.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The project's approach of developing an integrated adsorption technology in residential gas furnaces to reduce oxidation from sulfur content garnered mixed reactions from reviewers. While some reviewers found this approach to be interesting, sound, and addressing a real need, others noted that this was a temporary patch to a solution, and the long-term performance may need further examination. The majority of the reviewers commented that, if successful, the impacts on efficiency and cost-effectiveness could be significant. One reviewer, however, cautioned that the conservative HVAC industry would be reluctant to use this type of technology, and it could face market adoption trouble.</p>
<p>Almost all of the reviewers agreed that, given the early stage of the project, it is on target and making good progress. One reviewer noted that the absorbent remains to be scaled up in the right form factor, and a viable approach for its regeneration should be developed. Overall, there was unanimous consent that the project team had collaborated with appropriate stakeholders, including Rheem and Corning, though one reviewer commented the industry involvement should go beyond furnace providers.</p>
<p>Two reviewers recommended developing a regeneration strategy in the remaining project work, with a clear analysis of the consequences that could result from the failure of the acidic gas trapping (AGT) component. But overall reviewers were pleased with the clearly outlined remaining work.</p>
<p>Reviewers applauded the project team's diverse expertise, as well as their interest in exploring the important problem of reducing corrosion in boilers to enhance performance and longevity. On the other hand, reviewers did express concern regarding the project's cost-effectiveness, the undefined regeneration process, and the long-term performance of the nano-array-based monolith.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers applauded the project's approach of developing a new heat exchanger technology that uses improved casting processes to manufacture&nbsp;heat exchangers (HXs)&nbsp;as single units. This new approach to HX fabrication could ""revolutionize the industry,"" one reviewer commented. All but one reviewer found the project to have a potentially large and broad impact on the industry. Reviewers commented that beyond reducing costs and extending the life of the heat exchangers, the combination of Al-Ce could allow heat exchangers to be used in broader environments, like high temperature and high pressure. More critically, one reviewer expressed concern on the long-term use of cerium, a rare-earth metal requiring importation, as access to it may be dependent on international politics.</p>
<p>Reviewers were pleased with the progress the project has made&nbsp;and&nbsp;noted&nbsp;that despite its early stage, the progress completing the preliminary HX designs are very good and on track. One reviewer suggested&nbsp;that the&nbsp;materials research take precedent over the design and modeling as these are essential to this project.</p>
<p>Overall, the project team has collaborated with the appropriate stakeholders from industry and academia, reviewers found. One reviewer emphasized&nbsp;the importance of the team members focusing on the development of the material itself, its properties&nbsp;and&nbsp;performance, as the necessary tests and data collections will take time.</p>
<p>The newly developed alloy, the expertise in evaluating it, and the design of the single piece HX are all key project strengths, as noted by the reviewers. The reviewers also found the remaining project work to be well-thought-out, though one reviewer suggested&nbsp;the project team assess the pressure drop and wall roughness of the microchannel configuration. Though generally providing good scores, the reviewers identified the following potential weaknesses of the project: cost and availability of the new alloy, broad scope, fabrication of HX in one step through casting. To address these issues reviewers recommended collaborating with manufacturers of HX fabrication equipment, conventional fabrication of the HX, and focusing on the evaluation of the material itself.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers found the project's approach for a CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;refrigerator system interesting and&nbsp;innovative. One reviewer, however, expressed&nbsp;concern that the same benefits will be obtained with compressible and two-phase fluids used in refrigeration systems. While some reviewers commented that the project's impact would be significant, especially in reducing the cost of refrigeration and increasing the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub>, other reviewers noted the benefits may have been overestimated and&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;honest skepticism about the viability of the application.</p>
<p>Reviewers did not agree on the progress of the project; while some described the project as progressing with the modeling of the unit, others found the progress slow and not focused enough on the compressible liquids. Though the project team has identified strategic stakeholders, and has been discussing with experts in the industry, one reviewer suggested further literature review.</p>
<p>Innovation, strong analytics and modeling, and improved efficiency were all listed as project strengths by the reviewers. More critically, the reviewers questioned the cost-effectiveness and potential energy savings for the project given its complexity. As the project continues, the reviewers found the remaining work to be well-defined, but would recommend looking at an annualized model, and working beyond bench testing. Additionally, reviewers suggested the project team investigate alternative methods of pressure recovery, and modeling the complete system on a typical supermarket refrigeration system.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers found the approach to the self-powered gas furnace to be sound and reasonable. One reviewer commented on the notable market potential for this technology, though one reviewer added that while it may add marginal thermal performance by reducing parasitic costs, it will add significant resiliency to the systems under non-electricity scenarios like those during extreme weather events. More critically, one reviewer comments that although the approach is attractive, it is not new.</p>
<p>Generally, the reviewers noted that the projects could have strong potential to both maximize efficiency and provide autonomy and resilience during extreme events if successful. However, almost all reviewers note that this is only possible if the technology is cost-effective. One reviewer cautioned that ""the prospects for this to [be adapted into existing systems] appear to be low given the high risk of the concept."" Reviewers expressed confusion and disappointment that this project was considered ""early-stage,"" as it had been started in October 2017, and only general concept analysis had been completed after 18 months.</p>
<p>Four of the five reviewers noted that the project team should coordinate or collaborate with a furnace OEM, as such a partner could help identify practical design directions before a prototype is designed and developed. One reviewer recommends partnering with an OEM soon, as this may help with the remaining work. Looking at the other remaining milestones and project work, reviewers were surprised to see the amount of work left ahead, particularly the actual fabrication and testing of the unit. As the project continues, the reviewers noted a few weaknesses for the project team to focus on, including the NOx increase, the cost and scale of TE being too high, and comments on the slow progress to date.</p>
<p>More positively, reviewers applauded the project team for focusing on a real problem with a reasonable strategy to address the challenge. Moving forward, the reviewers recommend consulting similar work done at MIT and for tankless water heaters.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>All reviewers highly rated the project's approach of using computational fluid dynamics to develop analytical tools for a quick estimation of safe flammable refrigerant charge limits. Given the extensive use of refrigerants worldwide, this project will significantly impact the ability to safely utilize flammable refrigerants going forward, reviewers comment. The work will help with the adoption of flammable refrigerants, which have significant energy savings potential, another reviewer praises. One reviewer found the team had made ""excellent progress toward achieving the project goals,"" especially now that the project is nearly complete.</p>
<p>The project team demonstrated excellent strategic coordination with relevant stakeholders,&nbsp;as&nbsp;one reviewer noted. Another reviewer applauded&nbsp;the project's collaboration with AHRTI, ASHRAE and other industry stakeholders through an initial workshop to solicit input on needs.</p>
<p>Although the project is nearly complete, with the last major milestone to document and distribute information to stakeholders, one reviewer noted&nbsp;that the project has not yet hit the milestone of developing analytical tools for relatively quick estimation of safe flammable refrigerant charge limits. This reviewer recommended&nbsp;more research to address this project goal.</p>
<p>Two reviewers felt this was a key example of how to develop and distribute key technical information that will be received and adopted by decision-makers on codes and standards. One reviewer recommended the project team conduct fundamental experiments to measure some thermo-hydraulic properties of the new refrigerants in the future.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers offered favorable reviews of this project's approach to using an innovative ground heat exchanger (GHX) for geothermal&nbsp;(ground source)&nbsp;heat pump systems. Two reviewers specifically cited the potential of this project's approach to result in much lower drilling, installing, and operational costs. Another reviewer commended this project for beginning with lab testing of concept before moving to ground testing. Overall, reviewers concluded that the impact of this project could be far-reaching because of the potential reduction in operating costs. Two reviewers highlighted specific industries/applications that would benefit as well, including rural and standalone applications and the residential and small commercial building industry. However, one reviewer&nbsp;specified&nbsp;that more analysis needed to be conducted that compares the reduction in drilling costs with the increase in costs for the advanced geothermal system being tested.</p>
<p>There was unanimous consent among reviewers that the project is making good progress on its project-specific goals. Reviewers made sure to highlight the testing and evaluation that have been completed to date at the lab-level, though one reviewer wanted to see the overall impact on a typical house and the annual energy savings improvement. Regarding collaboration and coordination with relevant stakeholders, reviewer comments were more mixed. Four out of the five reviewers believed that stakeholders were ""limited"" as this stage. Two reviewers specifically called out the team for needing more&nbsp;ground source heat pump / water source heat pump&nbsp;manufacturers and home builders involved with the project.</p>
<p>Most reviewers believed that the project was on pace to complete the remaining project-specific goals. However, at least two reviewers offered areas where future project work could be focused, including: 1) investigations on effects of humidity in soil and the need to consider frost line depth in middle and upper states, and 2) studies on actual buildings coupled with cost/economic analyses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers appeared satisfied with this project's approach to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. The integration of piezoelectric sensors-actuators into heat exchanger (HX)&nbsp;headers was commended by two reviewers as a practical and novel approach to mitigating flow maldistribution. One reviewer was specifically interested in how the location and magnitude of piezo-crystal waves would affect the two-phase flow instabilities. Another reviewer would have liked the project team to provide an overview of the ""few viable and cost-effective solutions"" that currently exist so that he/she could compare the team's current approach against existing approaches.</p>
<p>All three reviewers believed that, if successful, this project could contribute to program goals by increasing HX capacity for improved system efficiency by&nbsp;more than&nbsp;10% thereby resulting in important energy savings. However, one reviewer expressed concern that these savings may not outweigh the potential leakage that could occur due to sensors causing additional penetrations in the system. Another reviewer noted that, because of the added complexity of this approach, it would be helpful for the team to measure the effectiveness of ultrasonic waves in mitigating two-phase flow maldistribution.</p>
<p>The reviewers were also convinced that the project team had met?its project-specific goals outlined thus far. Two out of the three reviewers cited both the CFD modeling and the setup for the benchtop testing as significant deliverables that would contribute to this project's progress. Similarly, most reviewers lauded the current collaboration and coordination efforts with relevant stakeholders, including HX manufacturers. However, one reviewer was unclear whether these efforts were planned or ongoing from the onset of the project and advised that the project team consider adding an industry partner to the team.</p>
<p>The reviewers unanimously believed that the remaining project work was well-planned and reasonable. However, the same reviewer who was hesitant to affirm the current collaboration efforts, again, recommended that the project team consider adding a manufacturer as a member to the team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Calling this project's approach ""quite comprehensive"" and nicely planned, two of the project's three reviewers expressed confidence in this project's ability to overcome the technical challenges associated with producing lower-cost and more-compact heat exchangers through additive manufacturing. However, two reviewers questioned how the issue of refrigerant leakages would be handled by these new designs. For instance, one reviewer cautioned that in the development of an air-to-air heat exchanger, polymer de-gassing issues and the effect of water vapor on the refrigerant mixture would need to be addressed by the project team.</p>
<p>Every reviewer agreed that this project, if successful, could significantly advance BTO's goal of reducing the manufacturing cost of heat exchangers. One reviewer noted that the project's estimated energy savings of 500&nbsp;TBtu&nbsp;would make a significant contribution to BTO's overall goal of reducing building energy use by 45%.</p>
<p>Even though this project had only begun six months earlier in October 2018, all three reviewers agreed that the project had made significant progress to date, and appreciated the sample heat exchangers that the project team included in their presentation. Two reviewers were confident that the project's remaining work was well-planned and achievable, although one reviewer would have appreciated more information on how appropriate these designs were for some refrigerants that the project referenced, as well as what the&nbsp;optimal pressure rating&nbsp;for the targeted applications would need to be. This reviewer asked that this information be considered in subsequent work.</p>
<p>Every reviewer remarked that the project team was coordinating and collaborating well with its&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;so far, although one reviewer would have liked to hear if the project team had established periodic,&nbsp;dedicated meetings&nbsp;with the project's entire set of&nbsp;stakeholders&nbsp;moving forward. If not, this reviewer suggested they add this to their schedule moving forward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers gave their highest&nbsp;marks&nbsp;in this project to its&nbsp;approach, even though no other aspect of this project earned more suggestions for improvement from the reviewers than this one. While every reviewer expressed confidence in the approach's comprehensiveness and feasibility, one reviewer was not convinced that the team's heat exchanger design had the right form factor to effectively reduce the refrigerant charge limit. Instead, the reviewer suggested that the project team consider redesigning the condenser module&nbsp;and/or water-tank. Another reviewer recommended that the project team focus more on non-HFO refrigerants (R290 and R600) than&nbsp;A2L and A3&nbsp;due to environmental concerns.</p>
<p>Despite these misgivings, every reviewer expected this project to have a significant impact on the energy performance of high-performance water heaters (HPWHs) and the diffusion of alternative refrigerants. Additionally, every reviewer remarked that the project team had made significant progress both on the modeling and experimental components of their project.</p>
<p>Reviewers&nbsp;did not express any concern about the project's remaining work, nor the team's strategic collaboration and coordination efforts. Several reviewers remarked that the project team had identified and included the key industry stakeholders, and that their work was being heavily cited in academic publications and conferences.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments&nbsp;</h4>
<p>While all three reviewers expressed confidence in the project's approach to overcome technical barriers and risks, two reviewers suggested the project team could benefit from focusing subsequent research on the system's size, which they ultimately intend to reduce by 30%. The currently proposed system, one reviewer acknowledged, does increase the regeneration efficiency, but the whole process is still limited by the dehumidification step. The team's approach could be improved, this reviewer said, first by determining the&nbsp;dehumidification process's&nbsp;RMC range, then by examining the ultrasonic regeneration energy needed at different RMC ranges, and finally be evaluating the durability of the moisture-absorbing materials. Nevertheless, all three reviewers were convinced that a successful prototype could considerably reduce the energy required to dry clothes &ndash; if the aforementioned challenges are effectively overcome in subsequent research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each reviewer said the project had made substantial progress to date, with two reviewers expressing confidence that the team's remaining project work was well-planned to meet the project's goals. One reviewer disagreed, though, saying the project appeared to be ""behind schedule"" and that the two-year timeline may have been ""too optimistic"" to avoid a future project extension. In terms of the project's collaboration with its stakeholders, two of the three reviewers described it as ""excellent"" and ""extensive,"" although one reviewer wished the project had included a&nbsp;desiccant&nbsp;or dehumidification unit manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Multiple reviewers commented that the project approach to&nbsp;increase the heat transfer process in flooded&nbsp;heat exchangers (HX),&nbsp;such as evaporators or condensers,&nbsp;by using&nbsp;metal foam surfaces&nbsp;is an appropriate and sound concept.?One reviewer&nbsp;encouraged&nbsp;the team to&nbsp;be aware of extensive pool boiling literature on refrigerants, mostly from the spray cooling for electronics community.?One reviewer&nbsp;recommended the project team&nbsp;address issues that may arise at the system level, not reflected in controlled lab conditions, such as dry-out locations, and pressure drop typical of the metal foam systems.&nbsp;One reviewer noted that appropriate selection of the extended surface is crucial to provide enhanced heat removal and&nbsp;avoid&nbsp;critical heat flux.</p>
<p>One reviewer remarked that the project team should focus on technology demonstration and leave&nbsp;follow-up&nbsp;efforts to focus on commercialization.&nbsp;Another reviewer suggested developing&nbsp;a narrow sprint path, to get some small element of commercialization complete&nbsp;and then use that information to inform and drive the larger opportunity.&nbsp;A few reviewers noted that the boiling heat transfer on the refrigerant side of the tubes is not the limiting factor on heat transfer in a cooler, it is the single-phase heat transfer on the water side inside the tubes.?Thus, some analysis should be done to see if enhancement on the water side is needed.</p>
<p>Reviewers had mixed reviews of project impact. One reviewer commented that the impact of the project toward accomplishing DOE energy-efficiency goals could be large and significant.?HXs&nbsp;are the key enabling technology for most HVAC systems,&nbsp;thus&nbsp;improvements in their performance could scale to the expected values DOE is projecting for 2030.?Another reviewer remarked&nbsp;that this project has a good chance of providing an incremental change in system design and performance.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;some concerns about how broadly applicable the technology will actually be once commercialized.?However, another&nbsp;reviewer commented that whether or not this effort will provide a commercially viable product, there is a good probability that this work will enhance the research literature in this important area of heat transfer. One reviewer&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that the research is unlikely to produce any useful results.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted the project appears to be on schedule and has achieved its major milestones to date.?One reviewer&nbsp;flagged&nbsp;that most chiller manufacturers make their own heat exchangers for their commercial products.?Therefore, manufacturing the enhanced surface materials in commercial quantities may involve major investments that HVAC manufacturers are unwilling to spend, so the commercialization process may take longer or be more difficult than anticipated.?Another reviewer agreed that the timeframe for commercialization will be longer than expected.&nbsp;Multiple reviewers&nbsp;were concerned about&nbsp;the major uncertainties of the project:&nbsp;cost and manufacturability.&nbsp;One reviewer even suggested another&nbsp;follow-on project that specifically addresses the cost-effective manufacture of such enhanced surface tubing.</p>
<p>A couple of reviewers commented that the team is excellent and diverse, with a very good mix of academic and industrial expertise.?One reviewer noted the team is&nbsp;taking advantage of the strengths of the national lab facilities with input from&nbsp;academic and industrial partners as appropriate.&nbsp;Another highlighted the good communication among the different stakeholders, remarking that feedback is being integrated in the development process.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;recommended further&nbsp;peer review to preemptively consider project challenges.&nbsp;Another reviewer commented that further collaboration with the academic and industrial community involved in heat transfer enhancement techniques could add value to the project.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that the project team did not seem&nbsp;to fully understand the basics of the pool boiling process&nbsp;and should therefore add team members with boiling expertise.&nbsp;One reviewer highly recommended a consultation with Carrier or other manufacturers for the remaining project work.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers noted that the test plan for the remaining work seems appropriate.&nbsp;A couple reviewers highlighted the&nbsp;significant resources of the lab, the broad range expertise of the project team, and the industrial collaborations. A few reviewers&nbsp;were pleased by&nbsp;the innovative and rigorous scientific approach of the project.&nbsp;One&nbsp;reviewer noted that the project concept could drive significant energy savings and have unintended benefits in other areas.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>All reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that the project has a novel approach in comparison to traditional investment casting, as it avoids many of the post-casting processes&nbsp;and could greatly improve some issues with the existing manufacturing process. Multiple reviewers&nbsp;called out&nbsp;that the project team needs to do additional work to verify quality, surface finish, resolution of fabricated parts, porosity, and cost. One reviewer commented that it appears the quality of parts depends on the size of the sands selected for the 3D-printing mold.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;flagged&nbsp;that it is not clear how the proposed thermo-economic features will be realized. Additionally, they noted it is not clear whether the surface finish quality of the proposed casting approach will be better than existing casting techniques.</p>
<p>All reviewers remarked that the&nbsp;project offers a substantial cost saving on impeller manufacturing by combining shroud and impeller fabrication steps.&nbsp;All reviewers&nbsp;observed&nbsp;the&nbsp;significant&nbsp;potential&nbsp;energy savings&nbsp;through isothermal compression and oil-less compression. One reviewer noted that this project addresses challenges with the existing brazing process, allowing for potentially improved yield results for manufacturers.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;reviewer commented on the project's ability to be used with alternative refrigerants.&nbsp;One reviewer highlighted that the new process offers manufacturing reliability.</p>
<p>Two reviewers commented that the project seems on track to meet stated goals, as&nbsp;one reviewer remarked that the team&nbsp;made excellent?progress toward achieving their&nbsp;goals&nbsp;and&nbsp;another commented that the remaining scope of work looks good. Another noted they are interested to see the results of the Neutron Imaging, as that has not been done before for this type of process. One reviewer proposed that the team consider the cooling rate offered by embedded cooling channels at different conditions, as it is not clear that the target isothermal compression can be solely realized by the cooling channels. One reviewer suggested that a comprehensive&nbsp;computational fluid dynamics (CFD)&nbsp;analysis might provide detailed insight into the air compression process before actual fabrication and testing.&nbsp;One reviewer recommended including compression testing in the project scope, as it is hard to verify the reliability and performance of the new fabricated impeller without such testing.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented&nbsp;that the team members have excellent?strategic coordination with relevant stakeholders, and another highlighted the team strength and expertise.?However, other reviewers noted it was difficult to determine the extent of collaboration, especially with Danfoss and Ingersoll Rand.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;expressed&nbsp;that a better understanding of the interest level of the technology from industrial partners would be helpful to determine the practicality of adoption in their manufacturing processes.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The majority of reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;the project approach is interesting and practical and could help to reduce refrigerant leakage. One reviewer commented that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong need for low-cost and reliable sensors for sensing refrigerants&nbsp;due to the Kigali agreement.&nbsp;That reviewer remarked that the&nbsp;project outlines a novel new approach that could have important cost reductions and improvements for the sensors using A2L refrigerants.?One reviewer complemented the&nbsp;good effort in identifying technologies suitable for this application.&nbsp;One reviewer commented that project weaknesses include limited fluids and low accuracy.&nbsp;Another reviewer suggested incorporating&nbsp;the project&nbsp;with low cost performance sensing/calculating.&nbsp;Other reviewers&nbsp;recommended the team&nbsp;verify lifetime of&nbsp;the&nbsp;sensors?and sensor calibration, improve impact analysis, and conduct cost analysis and production evaluations.&nbsp;One reviewer commented that the team should look at the new UL60079-2 standard, which is what the safety standards plan to reference.</p>
<p>A few reviewers&nbsp;applauded&nbsp;the importance of the project, as refrigerant leakage from commercial systems can be significant, as much as 10% to 30%, making it both a cost and environmental issue.&nbsp;They commented that&nbsp;the development of low-cost and accurate leak detection sensors for a range of refrigerant types, especially flammable refrigerants, is an impactful goal, especially since sensors of this type are presently not available.&nbsp;One reviewer noted the key to project success is how well the technology can be reliably applied.&nbsp;However, another reviewer critiqued that the current impact analysis is somewhat vague. One reviewer warned&nbsp;that sensing leakage somewhere in the system may not be sufficient to encourage remedy action. This reviewer suggested that for low charge systems, a means to sense deterioration in performance may be more compelling.</p>
<p>Many reviewers commented on good technical progress, though a few&nbsp;voiced concerns over&nbsp;the lack of evaluating flexible sensor characteristics, including drifts and calibrations.&nbsp;Reviewer comments on remaining work were relatively positive,&nbsp;and&nbsp;one reviewer commented&nbsp;that they look forward to the final results and conclusions of&nbsp;prototype performance. One reviewer suggested adding repeatability and lifetime assessment to the remaining project work. Others observed it will be important to see how the comprehensive evaluation of sensor performance progresses this year.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted the team is working with multiple key industry stakeholders, including&nbsp;the Air&nbsp;Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Technology Institute (AHRTI), Emerson and&nbsp;Mexchem. However, one reviewer&nbsp;remarked&nbsp;that the team needs system manufacturers or service organizations, while&nbsp;another suggested increasing involvement with&nbsp;the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute (AHRI).&nbsp;One reviewer highlighted that the project team&nbsp;seems to understand the market need.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;highlighted the strength of the staff, especially with their prior work in this area of printed sensors.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of&nbsp;Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>One reviewer commented that the&nbsp;project&nbsp;approach seems appropriate. A few reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that this is a critical project to support work in industry to switch to lower&nbsp;global warming potential (GWP)&nbsp;refrigerants.?Multiple reviewers noted this project has a good experimental setup to investigate leakage rates of flammable refrigerants, with one reviewer highlighting the well-thought-out controlled experiments.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;cautioned&nbsp;that while&nbsp;this was desired by the Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Technology Institute (AHRTI),&nbsp;it might?have been more valuable to the industry if a more controlled scientific experiment had been devised that could be better correlated to other equipment types, sizes and configurations.?One reviewer&nbsp;noted&nbsp;that the project team has developed simplified tools, but they need to be further validated.?</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;on the importance of this project, as the results could be extremely valuable to the adoption and use of potentially flammable low-GWP refrigerants. One reviewer noted that this project will enable the use of new flammable refrigerants in a manner that eliminates or minimizes flammability issues. Another&nbsp;remarked&nbsp;that this is needed research to help the industry understand possible implications of the use of flammable refrigerants on system design and maintenance. One reviewer commented that the project is unlikely to address the wide range of concerns of regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>The majority of reviewers commented that the project is demonstrating good progress to date. One reviewer remarked that the results to date have been inconclusive and have not helped validate the UL60335-2-40 proposed mitigation.?This reviewer noted that the next phase of the project is critical,&nbsp;but there are facility issues and conflicts with other projects at Oak Ridge&nbsp;National Laboratory&nbsp;that may not result in the tests that are desired.?Most reviewers observed that the remaining project work seems appropriate and can be completed as planned. One reviewer expressed that this is a very high-priority project and needs to be completed by late summer to early fall to support code hearings.?To do so, this reviewer flagged that the work needs to be accelerated.</p>
<p>Many reviewers noted the primary stakeholder engagement is the partnership with AHRTI.&nbsp;A few reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that the project has very good stakeholder involvement.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;remarked&nbsp;that the partnership with AHRTI, as well as the AHRI/ASHRAE/CA/DOE collaboration,&nbsp;is important for codes and standards development.&nbsp;While one reviewer commented that the project team is working very closely with AHRI and industry manufacturers, the majority of reviewers&nbsp;agreed&nbsp;that further stakeholder engagement would be beneficial for the project. Reviewers suggested engaging the system manufacturers,&nbsp;original equipment manufacturers (OEM)&nbsp;engineering teams, and worldwide organizations involved in evaluating the use of refrigerants.</p>
<p>One reviewer commented that the strength of the project is that it is working to solve one of the major issues associated with the use of flammable refrigerants, which is the magnitude and distribution of the refrigerant that is released into a living space when an uncontrolled refrigerant leak occurs.&nbsp;One reviewer noted that presented experimental data does not show any error bars, which are&nbsp;important especially in the correlation work.&nbsp;One reviewer&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;the team needs to characterize liquid line length or initial charge.&nbsp;One reviewer remarked&nbsp;that the project is unlikely to satisfy many in the industry who approve new refrigerants for a wide variety of equipment sizes and types.&nbsp;A couple reviewers&nbsp;observed&nbsp;that it&nbsp;would be helpful to expand the number of tested refrigerants, including low-GWP alternative refrigerants,&nbsp;and test conditions (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc.).</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers generally found the SaltX project approach to develop a heat operated heat pump system that uses ammonia-based fluid encapsulated in a desorption matrix to be sound. Two reviewers, however, commented that practical efficiency limitations may prevent the team from reaching the eventual project targets. Responses from reviewers varied significantly for the project's impact. While some reviewers noted that the poor performance to this point does not bode well for meeting project targets, other reviewers found the project addressed BTO goals and would be impactful if successful and cost-effective.</p>
<p>Again, reviewers did not agree on how well the project was progressing, partially due to the project's difficulty meeting performance targets. One reviewer noted that the project is at an early stage and good progress has been made according to the working plan.;</p>
<p>Although the project is partnered with Rheem, two reviewers did not understand the scope of this relationship, and wanted more details of the ""active collaboration."" Another reviewer recommended collaborating with experts in heat exchangers design in the future. Reviewers did not rate the remaining project work well, finding it had been delayed and unlikely to achieve its initial performance targets. The prototyping laid out in the remaining work may present challenges and obstacles that the team did not properly plan to mitigate, another reviewer noted.</p>
<p>Almost all reviewers agreed the project strength is its innovation and clear path forward. However, the low engagement of the OEM, the early stage, and the fundamental limitations are some of the project&rsquo;s weaknesses, reviewers commented. To address these challenges, reviewers recommended more OEMs be brought onto the team, testing the sorption solution under lab conditions, and conducting a detailed theoretical analysis to identify sources of inefficiencies.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project clearly outlines a well-formulated and thought-out approach to develop an ultrasonic drying technology using piezoelectric elements that vibrate fabrics at high frequency to remove water, reviewers noted. One reviewer applauded the project's innovation, saying the utilization of the piezoelectric elements was a significant departure from incumbent technology that relies on evaporation of the water.</p>
<p>Unanimously, reviewers agreed this project could have a substantial impact and could revolutionize the clothes drying industry. Beyond dryers, this technology could be applied to desalination, heat exchangers and dehumidification, one reviewer noted. Again, all reviewers agreed the project staff had demonstrated strategic partnerships with manufacturers, particularly GE Appliances and Virginia Tech, through the&nbsp;cooperative research and development agreement&nbsp;(CRADA).</p>
<p>Of the remaining project work, reviewers commented that the project was on track, with one reviewer recommending the team dedicate substantial resources to the design and evaluation of a dryer configuration that leads to the highest energy factor possible. As the project continues, another reviewer recommended&nbsp;dedicating resources to investigate the expected remaining moisture content from the proposed technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Generally, reviewers found the project team's approach of developing and promoting non-vapor compression cooling technologies promising and worth further investigation. Though one reviewer commented&nbsp;that the prototype developing is reasonable, another reviewer recommended&nbsp;that the team analyze the decade-worth developments existing in this field and presents an analytical comparison outlining the benefits of this approach.</p>
<p>Many reviewers expressed confusion as to the impact of the project&nbsp;and&nbsp;commented that&nbsp;it was difficult to discern the progress based on the presentation and due to its early stage. However, other reviewers noted&nbsp;that, if successful and cost-competitive, the technology may provide significant energy savings benefits to the commercial and residential cooling markets.</p>
<p>To this point, the project team has made good progress on the project's modeling work and beginning stages of experimental work with Galinstan, reviewers found. One reviewer recommended&nbsp;the project team finalizes a target application and system configuration in the future.</p>
<p>The reviewers did not find the project team had adequately collaborated with stakeholders&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;many recommended&nbsp;more significant strategic collaborations&nbsp;with refrigerator and cooler OEMs. The project team's presentation on remaining work outlined much to be studied experimentally with Galinstan. Reviewers expressed concern with the short timeline given to achieve this work, although the majority did find the plan to be well-defined.</p>
<p>All of the reviewers praised the project's innovative idea to improve heat transfer of magnetocaloric cooling technology. Unfortunately, the reviewers&nbsp;pointed to&nbsp;the cost-effectiveness, loose results, and lack of an&nbsp;OEM partnership as project weaknesses. As the project continues, the reviewers made some recommendations to address these challenges. Two reviewers noted&nbsp;their interest in seeing an assessment or conclusion of the technology, another reviewer recommended first selecting target applications, and working with them for setting up operating conditions.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The majority of the reviewers found the project approach of using IR cameras to understand and optimize heat flow in heat exchangers to be sound, even though it is at an early stage. More critically, one reviewer recommended&nbsp;the project team design system architecture for the target application first to achieve a meaningful outcome. The presenter did not clearly outline the potential impact of the project, reviewers found.</p>
<p>Given that the project started in October 2018, the reviewers were generally pleased with the progress that had been made. One reviewer&nbsp;suggested&nbsp;that the project team incorporate optional designs and alternative enhancement techniques to analyze at the beginning of the project.</p>
<p>Reviewers noted&nbsp;that not many industry partners were identified in this project, partly because this is a ""fundamental"" project and likely won't require stakeholder engagement until year two and three. Nonetheless, one reviewer suggested&nbsp;that the team should&nbsp;seek&nbsp;feedback on what industry partners and stakeholders may wish to employ this technology soon. The remaining project work is mostly upcoming as the project is in its early stages, most reviewers noted. One reviewer recommended&nbsp;designing system architecture for target application before fabrication of&nbsp;a&nbsp;prototype.</p>
<p>Reviewers provided feedback on potential areas the project team could strengthen. One reviewer noted&nbsp;that the current design approach may by limited to condensers and radiators.&nbsp;Similarly,&nbsp;another reviewer commented that&nbsp;there may not be widespread applications once successfully developed.&nbsp;As&nbsp;the project continues, one reviewer recommended&nbsp;focusing on low-capacity thermoelectric air to air cooling systems, while another suggested&nbsp;the team&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;economic and manufacturing analysis on the design. For the thermoelectric refrigerator, one reviewer suggested&nbsp;the thermal resistance of interface between the TE and rotating heat exchanger (RHX) be carefully addressed.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers approved of this approach to develop and commercialize a simple absorption system for residential markets. One reviewer commented that the approach is typical and appropriate. Another reviewer praised the&nbsp;principal&nbsp;investigator for making steady progress over many years to bring this technology to market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the product will be successful if it can be accepted by the market. If ammonia is accepted by industry, this technology would be a viable gas-fired heat pump for cold climates. One reviewer cautioned that if the costs can be managed, this system could prove to be quite acceptable in some cities, but there are a lot of non-technical factors that will determine if this system becomes commercially successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project has made good progress. The project seems to have met all the targets that were identified in advance. One reviewer praised the team for being able to secure commercial certifications for commercial-scale units, complete two units, complete design for manufacturing, and identify the two locations for cold climate field testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most reviewers approved of the project's good collaboration and coordination. The team is heavily engaged with the corresponding stakeholders, including manufacturers, installers, utilities, and professional organizations. However, one reviewer questioned exactly which manufacturer is interested to jump in, design, manufacture, and market this product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project is on track to accomplish the remaining project goals of demonstrating commercial scale units of the proposed gas-fired absorption heat pump with the expected performance metrics. The remaining work is clearly defined. One reviewer suggested the team should have further engagement of the manufacturers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most of the reviewers approved of the approach to utilize structured surfaces to wick braze alloy to brazing joint areas, thereby?creating stronger braze joints. The research would include all types of joints including braze alloy/flux-phobic or -philic&nbsp;to allow assistance in directing the brazing materials. One reviewer commented that it would have been good to have better controls on the brazing process that was utilized for testing because it seemed to provide unreliable results in the project testing because of poor quality of the joints.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the impact of the project would be seen in the stronger brazed joints. Another big impact from the project would be the reduced manufacturing costs. As one reviewer pointed out, since the performance of refrigerant systems are less effective as the refrigerant charge decreases, 10-50&nbsp;TBtu&nbsp;cost savings are projected.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that the inconsistent results of some of the testing are questionable due to the lack of quality control on the test samples (brazed joints).&nbsp;Interestingly, all joints (treated and untreated) failed in base metal and not in braze joint. The other reviewer noted that there is a significant amount of work still to be done.</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that there appears to be collaboration and coordination with stakeholders, but reviewers disagreed on the extent of the collaboration. One reviewer highlighted that the team members have excellent?strategic coordination with relevant stakeholders. However, another reviewer expressed concerns that there was a disconnect sometime during the middle of the project.?In particular, the automated brazing facility being developed by UIUC appears not to be feasible.</p>
<p>Reviewers pointed out additional remaining work, including utilizing the automated brazing machine, creating and brazing larger-scale braze joints, conducting an initial assessment of manufacturability, performing reliability testing of the new brazing process to compare to current brazing techniques, conducting cost analysis of the new brazing process, and implementing a commercialization plan. The additional testing utilizing the automated brazing machine should help to shore up some of the unreliable results. One reviewer praised the team for the well-planned remaining project work.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>All reviewers approved of the approach to design and manufacture high-performance, reduced charge heat exchangers (HX). This is a promising project with huge ramifications to the industry for the reduction of refrigerant use and for performance and efficiency improvements. Reviewers commented that the approach for making and testing prototypes and sending several for independent validation is good, and the team has a good understanding of the challenges for commercialization.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the biggest impact will be seen in the smaller coils (lighter and less expensive) and the reduced charge (30%). The project goals of reducing refrigerant charges by 30% or more are impactful in that this will be a significant step toward promoting the use of non-GWP refrigerants that may otherwise be flammable in larger quantities. Reviewers generally agreed that this project is of importance and significance because if successful, it can bring good savings and improvements to the market.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the project is showing excellent progress. The project seems to be proceeding on track in the design and fabrication stages, and they have engaged with major tooling suppliers and manufacturers. One reviewer commented that new PPFSA design optimization and fabrication?of the targeted prototypes have been initiated according to the project scope.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers praised the project's collaboration and coordination, particularly with industrial partners. The project team has engaged with the major suppliers and manufacturers and they have made very good efforts in publishing results. One reviewer recommended having some AC equipment manufacturers involved in the development of these products.</p>
<p>Many of the reviewers agreed that the remaining project work is well-planned. Most of the remaining project work is constructing HX prototypes and performing experimental evaluations, and the outlined remaining scope corresponds to the project targets and anticipated outcomes. One reviewer highlighted that the manufacturing process and costs are critical, so the full cost study needs to be part of the project.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most of the reviewers approved of the approach to use a low-pressure low global-warming potential (GWP) refrigerant. Although one reviewer found this project approach difficult to assess, most reviewers agreed that the approach is excellent and the project looks to be well-developed, they understand the root challenges, and they were addressing them head on. One reviewer praised the project because it is clear that UTRC plans to develop this product into a commercially sold product line and they have a very clear set of objectives and targets to reach that commercial objective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the reviewers agreed that this project will lead to energy savings and contribute to overall DOE goals for energy efficiency and low GWP refrigerants. Significant improvements in performance have been achieved relative to the baseline and this is valuable. One reviewer highlighted that rooftop units account for a high percentage of commercial A/C systems, so improving their performance will have an impact on the overall commercial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project is showing good progress. The project appears to be on schedule and the targets set for the work are largely met. One reviewer expressed concerns if the first prototype completion continues to slip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reviewers agreed that the project's collaboration and coordination is exclusively carried out by UTRC and their manufacturing arm, Carrier. Reviewers suggested additional collaboration&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;with someone with greater knowledge of heat transfer and pressure drop in two-phase flow and end users, at the appropriate time, to ensure that units have good remote fault diagnostics. Another reviewer highlighted that it is difficult to assess collaboration when so many aspects of the project cannot be revealed, so it is difficult to gauge how deeply involved everyone may be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the remaining project work includes making the prototypes, optimization of various components, lab-level testing, cost analysis, and commercialization.&nbsp;From what was shown, the project looks to be well-planned and well-run. The project appears to be on schedule and the team is marching toward its ultimate goal of commercialization, with very clear targets and timelines for the rest of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, the reviewers approved of the project's approach to develop a new HVAC system that eliminates most mechanical systems by using the combination of an electro-chemical?compression?(ECC), a heat exchanger for hydrogen solutions, and a liquid desiccant system that takes advantage of the wasted heat from the ECC-based heat pump. The approach does seem to be making progress in solving the many technical challenges and the overall approach is on the mark. However, one reviewer disagreed&nbsp;and&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that the absorber configuration is fundamentally wrong and won't deliver a reasonable performance.</p>
<p>Many reviewers agreed that, if successful, this project's impact could be significant for improving energy savings and vapor compression technologies. The scope of the work is broad, and it seems that any of the three technical areas discussed could have derivative applications in addition to the stated heat pumps and the ULT freezers. However, two reviewers disagreed&nbsp;and stated&nbsp;that project goals won't be met with this absorber design and the parts and the whole unit appear too early stage and complex.</p>
<p>The reviewers were split on their feedback on the project's progress, with some reviewers praising the project for its good progress. Other reviewers criticized the presentation, commenting that it was not well-organized, and it was hard to tell from the presentation the expected milestones and achievement relative to those goals. Another reviewer explained that the dehumidification performance and its associated system integration are not done because the developed absorber will short-circuit the cold and hot sides of the cooling cycle and kill the system performance without doing dehumidification.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that the project team includes a range of expertise, but most of the reviewers agreed that the project is lacking collaboration and coordination. While the work reportedly is making significant progress, it is not clear what some of the other partners are doing, such as Haier and Delaware, who were both mentioned, but no information was provided on what they are doing. Reviewers would also like to see more team members with a good scientific background on this subject and more field-experienced individuals.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the remaining work includes a path to commercialization, but reviewers disagreed on whether this path is reasonably achievable. The remaining project work is to make this technology real, so it will be interesting to see if the compressor and other systems will truly be a good fit for the window unit and the low temperature freezer, but it is difficult to assess the commercial viability and market-readiness of such unit. Another reviewer stated that this project will not achieve the promised dehumidification function.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the approach of building on the known technology of a red LED is a reasonable and promising approach. Reviewers commented that if the project yields the expected results, it will achieve significant increases&nbsp;in efficiency with no barriers of adoption?by LED manufacturers and the results so far have indicated very good progress toward the project goals. However, one reviewer noted&nbsp;that the project is purely experimental.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that the project is expected to contribute to program goals. Specifically, reviewers commented that the project is well-aligned with DOE's goal to fill the green gap and the project will have a transformative impact on the field of electric lighting in buildings. One reviewer commented that the approach should work if the single crystal synthesis is stable for this composition. Another reviewer expressed concern about the real-world impact on building energy savings.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project has shown good progress&nbsp;thus&nbsp;far. Two reviewers commented that the project is still in the early stages (five to six months into the project). One reviewer&nbsp;described&nbsp;the progress to date&nbsp;and emphasized&nbsp;optimization of?the energetic barriers through control of the order parameter and demonstration that the team can obtain exceedingly high energetic barriers to inter-valley transfer in the new material.</p>
<p>In general, most reviewers agreed that the remaining project work is ambitious but reasonable and well-planned&nbsp;and collaborations are appropriate.&nbsp;Most of the reviewers agreed that the project currently has an adequate amount of collaboration with LED chip manufacturers, module and luminaire manufacturers, lighting designers and subject matter experts, and end users. One reviewer commented that this is the appropriate amount of collaboration, considering the funding level. Another reviewer highlighted&nbsp;that&nbsp;the team is&nbsp;collaborating with DOE Energy I-Corps in order to identify possible commercialization pathways.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>Reviewer feedback was well-received by the project team, and although reviewers noted potential issues regarding the stability of the project's AlInP alloy composition and ability to meet the stated quantum efficiency targets, the team is confident in its ability to meet these aggressive targets based on the fundamental band-structure of the material. To that end, the team is continually improving the required material quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PI also recognized reviewer comments on the potential impact on real-world lighting applications, and the team is engaging stakeholders across all levels of the LED lighting value chain to understand how improvements in red and amber LED efficiency can help address needs for near-, mid-, and long-term products in addition to meeting the efficiency and human health and comfort objectives articulated by the DOE. The team will report their findings on the potential impacts of this R&amp;D as part of this project moving forward.</p>",R&D - Solid-State Lighting

<p>All reviewers commented positively on the project's approach. Reviewers stated that the approach&nbsp;is an excellent starting point&nbsp;and&nbsp;is well-thought-out,&nbsp;well-planned,&nbsp;and should minimize risk of failure. However, one reviewer did comment that this project has the potential for a significant contribution, but there is much work to be completed.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that the project will have a high impact and&nbsp;will contribute positively to&nbsp;BTO's&nbsp;goals. Another reviewer commented that the program goals leading to adoption of widespread use are encouraging, but the reviewer recommended that building owners and manager edification become a priority for these goals to be attained. One reviewer acknowledged that additional efforts addressing lighting energy reduction for animal production will be investigated.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the project is on track and showing great progress, particularly in identifying&nbsp;the disconnect&nbsp;between installation instructions from manufacturers and actual installation by end users. However, one reviewer expressed concern over the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;for the project to lag, especially with the horticultural effort which includes scientific research on spectrum, intensity, etc., that will drive market adoption.</p>
<p>Reviewers were divided on the project coordination and collaboration. Two reviewers agreed that the project shows good collaboration, and significant collaboration and coordination has taken place with partners and stakeholders including several public presentations of work on the project. Contrastingly, two reviewers recommended more industry representation and involvement with collaborators who have little to no background in lighting to avoid biased results.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the remaining work is well-planned and&nbsp;appropriate. The reviewers emphasized remaining work, including&nbsp;outreach&nbsp;to other universities who are not currently collaborators, studying changes in the Chicago night sky from street lighting conversion, working on Light Measurement &amp; Automobile Crash Statistics with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, and proceeding with?horticultural lighting analysis. One reviewer recommended considering whether this project will meet its objectives in the&nbsp;specified&nbsp;timeframe.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Both reviewers approved of the project approach while one&nbsp;reviewer specified that the overall approach is comprehensive and attempts to address major areas of technical constraint, uncertainties, and barriers. A reviewer expressed concern that the project is taking on too much and won't be able to adequately complete the scope or achieve all the outcomes in the little time (FY2021) left in the project's operation.</p>
<p>Both reviewers commented positively on the project's impact. One reviewer&nbsp;emphasized that&nbsp;the project will provide meaningful impact to industry to accelerate adoption of standards, recommended practices, and minimum performance requirements, if the project is successful.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;this&nbsp;reviewer also expressed&nbsp;concern that the project's progress may fall behind and recommended additional evaluation after a year&nbsp;of project implementation.</p>
<p>The two&nbsp;reviewers agreed that the project has&nbsp;adequate&nbsp;collaboration and coordination. One reviewer praised the excellent project collaboration and coordination&nbsp;while the&nbsp;other reviewer&nbsp;commended&nbsp;the level of collaboration&nbsp;and coordination with industry as on par with what should be expected to accelerate adoption.</p>
<p>One reviewer stated that the progress on remaining work has been excellent. However, the other reviewer highlighted that the breadth of the project will make the remaining project work very ambitious to meet. Both reviewers praised project strengths such as the project's comprehensive approach to evaluating and reducing barriers to the myriad issues connected lighting might face (and doing so with industry collaboration) and the project's high impact. One reviewer recommended including discussions on adoption by end users or&nbsp;how to&nbsp;overcome&nbsp;the issues related to implementation.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Two reviewers approved of the approach, describing it as addressing the conflict between energy needs and human biological needs in a straightforward manner,&nbsp;while being&nbsp;very relevant and exploring many unknown territories. Reviewers&nbsp;also&nbsp;provided suggestions on how to improve the approach: one reviewer highlighted that the question related to non-visual effects doesn't seem as clearly articulated, and another noted that taking standards advanced by WELL&nbsp;seems fine, but it would help to develop surveys that get at the effects that are claimed. One reviewer suggested focusing on one item more than the others as the project progresses, since the&nbsp;project&nbsp;scope covers many areas.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the project is expected&nbsp;to contribute to program goals and&nbsp;stated&nbsp;that the work toward the energy-reduction goals is very clear and there is good potential for impact from all the tasks. Two reviewers emphasized the importance of meeting the non-visual needs of building occupants as a great benefit to the public. Because of this, one reviewer&nbsp;noted that&nbsp;achieving the energy goal is now a bigger challenge than what was previously assumed.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project has shown good progress toward exposing the energy gap between DOE's goals and specifications that address human needs. One reviewer praised that in this limited amount of time, the project achieved impressive results given&nbsp;that&nbsp;it explores&nbsp;an&nbsp;unknown&nbsp;field&nbsp;with little help from existing literature. Another reviewer highlighted that the second stage (non-visual) will be critical for contributing to the debate about how much energy is worth spending on non-visual effects.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the project involves many relevant stakeholders and good collaboration. One reviewer praised that the experimental testing is happening with the hospital in Emory,?Georgia,?and in classrooms in Sacramento, California, and using these rooms in their realistic setting not only serves the research but also reduces its cost to the bare minimum. One reviewer suggested including&nbsp;manufacturers and software developers as the technology progresses.</p>
<p>One reviewer recognized that the project will face challenges with a changing landscape of metrics, but the project staff has demonstrated a desire and ability to stay flexible in the complex environment. One reviewer suggested that future work should include a discussion of how data collected from the ongoing experimental testing may translate into new regulations regarding the qualitative aspect of lighting design, and how these new regulations may be enforced by code. Two reviewers expressed uncertainty about task 3, stating that much of task 3 will depend on the framing of the work subcontracted this coming summer and task 3 is non-existent, or nothing has started yet on task 3.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The project approach was approved by two reviewers. However, one reviewer suggested&nbsp;including some collaborators from the daylighting community as well, who have a slightly different view. Another reviewer commented that there was&nbsp;not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;discussion on&nbsp;the modeling and&nbsp;simulation approach.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that the project is expected to contribute to program goals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;one reviewer&nbsp;noted&nbsp;that the project will have a high impact. One reviewer highlighted that the goal is to evaluate whether CLS can provide any useful services to the grid and the project seems well-formulated to achieve that goal. However, one reviewer commented that&nbsp;the impact is not well-understood, and it is a fundamental aspect of this research.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers acknowledged that the project is still in the early stages of development,&nbsp;and has&nbsp;shown reasonable progress for this stage, mostly in fundamental background work.&nbsp;One reviewer praised that the project team has made good progress,&nbsp;however,&nbsp;another&nbsp;reviewer commented that there is much work still left to be completed.</p>
<p>The reviewers were divided on the project's level of coordination and collaboration. One reviewer praised the project for its outstanding collaboration, and another reviewer highlighted that the project advisory group suggestions seem very appropriate.&nbsp;In contrast, one reviewer&nbsp;commented&nbsp;that the listed collaborators and partners are very low and only includes NYSERDA. They suggested including more participation from utilities,&nbsp;regional transmission organizations (RTOs) / independent system operators (ISOs), end users, and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Looking forward, reviewers were varied on their outlook.&nbsp;One reviewer praised the project&nbsp;for its high expected success, while two reviewers agreed that there is a lot of work still left to be complete. One reviewer commented that&nbsp;the next stage will likely be decisive, as the key will be to formulate the simulation so it captures the dynamic potential of lighting systems. A final reviewer recommendation is to&nbsp;include the daylighting community to help incorporate potential environmental dynamics that might be amenable to grid interaction.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers praised the project approach as serving the valuable purpose of getting information to system manufacturers from installers that are typically not available. The ""Observational Research"" with experts in the field observing the installation and operation of the light fixtures being tested?in a lab setting and encouraging manufacturer's participation through a government-run competition is a good approach for market penetration. However, one reviewer warned that the choice of collaborative partners that have something to gain could lead to biased results.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers expected the project to meet program goals, with the results of this project expected to address a significant barrier in the adoption, installation and maintenance&nbsp;of energy-efficient lighting systems. One reviewer praised the project, stating that both programs, Outdoor and Horticultural, have potential major impacts on program goals, but the Outdoor program major impact&nbsp;appears&nbsp;more well-documented related to limiting sky glow while attaining energy savings. Another reviewer commented that the impact of this project is in the form of educational seminars, presentations offered, articles published, and the NGLS competition.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the project has shown good progress to date. The project has identified several improvement opportunities and communicated those to system manufacturers, reaching significant results in a short time. One reviewer highlighted that Outdoor Lighting is more mature than Horticultural Lighting, so the progress on metrics with Outdoor Lighting, as well as validating real-world models with data is impressive, but initial progress on Horticultural Lighting is limited.</p>
<p>Two reviewers approved of the project collaboration with several stakeholders, including major manufacturers,&nbsp;an expert panel of advisors, researchers, two universities, IESNA, lighting designers, and electric subcontractors. However,&nbsp;one&nbsp;reviewer expressed concern about limited collaboration and coordination efforts.&nbsp;For Outdoor Lighting, coordination efforts seem somewhat limited as this appears to be driven in a&nbsp;""top-down""&nbsp;management structure and progress for Horticultural Lighting related to developing collaboration is limited because this is a new program.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that&nbsp;the project is on track to achieve its goals with a realistic plan and timeline. One reviewer provided recommendations on how the project team should address the remaining work.&nbsp;For Outdoor Lighting, examination of crash statistics related to improved visual acuity of replacement LED systems should be expanded to several municipalities to add to the weight of evidence. For Horticultural/Agricultural Lighting, much work needs to be done to assess metrics and measurement methods in real field evaluations. This reviewer suggested using lighting in a&nbsp;real-time feedback scenario, not only to grow plants, but to control growth.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, the reviewers agreed that&nbsp;the project's approach contributed&nbsp;to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. The reviewers&nbsp;applauded&nbsp;the approach&nbsp;as one&nbsp;that is likely to see application in lighting and largely fundamental scientific research on&nbsp;GaN&nbsp;LEDs, which will benefit the broader SSL market. One reviewer highlighted that this project is still in the early stage, but the team&nbsp;is&nbsp;aware of immediate barriers and tactics for overcoming them.</p>
<p>Impacts were praised by one reviewer&nbsp;for&nbsp;the project's excellent impact potential while&nbsp;two reviewers described the project's specific goals and impact. It was noted that&nbsp;research is aimed at increasing the output of&nbsp;GaN&nbsp;LED at higher power densities, not by increasing current, but by increasing voltage.</p>
<p>Reviewers mostly agreed that the project is still in the early stages, but progress has been made, highlighting&nbsp;the team's demonstration of the electrical efficiency of the multilayer approach in diodes and their good progress with actual IV curves. However, one reviewer pointed out that&nbsp;no timeline was included with the project presentation.</p>
<p>The reviewers all approved of the project's collaboration, with one reviewer commenting that the two partners in the team seem well-prepared for the project and are collaborating with&nbsp;Lumileds, a respected LED manufacturer,&nbsp;on commercialization. Two reviewers suggested opportunities for additional collaboration&nbsp;and noted that&nbsp;more industry representation may be beneficial. Also, Ohio&nbsp;State&nbsp;University&nbsp;(OSU)&nbsp;has some new TEM equipment that might be useful for this project.</p>
<p>One reviewer stated that the&nbsp;remaining project work&nbsp;is&nbsp;logically organized, but that will depend on success in overcoming the obstacles that arise as additional layers are added to the assembly. Another&nbsp;reviewer suggested&nbsp;the project team look to scaling of manufacturing and temperature stability. Overall, the reviewers generally agreed that the project approach is a major strength, given that the approach is an interesting technical approach that addresses opportunities for efficiency gain in the fundamental science of SSL technologies that drive the overall LED market.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most of the reviewers approved of the project approach and stated that it establishes a good initial step at addressing the relationship between IAQ, air flows, and the air-sealing/weatherization program and the project's approach is likely to achieve program goals through validation of acceptable airflow rates/quantity/quality. However, one reviewer highlighted that this is too small of a sample size, over too long of a time period. Another reviewer suggested putting some thought into ways to tease out the difference, if any, between the control homes and the treatment homes.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that if successful, this project will shed light on the most cost-effective way to save energy in most homes: air-sealing. The goal&nbsp;is to show that homes with deeper levels of air-sealing and ventilation can be just as healthy, if not healthier, than homes with less air-sealing and air-sealing with good IAQ is critical to program goals. However, two reviewers disagreed and noted that the sample size is so small that it's hard to see how results could be extrapolated to the larger community and the impact on program goals remains to be firmly established.</p>
<p>Many reviewers agreed that project progress appears to have been somewhat hampered by the unexpected difficulty of finding target homes. Reviewers expressed disappointment that the team has only managed to cover 15 homes in three years. Although it was noted that they appear to have a good deal of data analysis remaining in the short time left in the project, two reviewers stated that the project is on track for completion to deliver expected results.</p>
<p>The reviewers were split on the degree to which the project staff demonstrates strategic collaboration or coordination with relevant stakeholders. Some reviewers praised that the project has excellent stakeholder engagement and collaboration with a variety of industry associations and&nbsp;academic and home performance contracting partners. Other reviewers expressed uncertainty regarding how they are relying on a larger stakeholder community and how results of the research will be disseminated.</p>
<p>Once again, the reviewers were divided on their opinions regarding the remaining planned work to meet the&nbsp;project-specific goals. Some reviewers expressed that the project will meet the project-specific goals and remaining work logically includes a significant amount of data analysis and promulgation of the results. However, other reviewers expressed concern about recruiting and testing out another 17 homes by September 2019. One reviewer suggested an extension to complete the planned number of field evaluations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Review Comments</h4>
<p>The approach to this project received a wide-ranging collection of comments from reviewers. Many of the reviewers approved of the project approach with one describing the understanding of the issues as ""outstanding and highly focused."" It was noted that manufactured houses often have unnecessarily poor energy performance due to construction details being overlooked by some manufacturers. A reviewer explained that the project's integrated design approach would be a smart strategy to address these issues. However, one reviewer disapproved of the project's approach and stated that ""the study is more of a design nature than offering innovative and new ideas."" It was also mentioned that the presentation ignored practices that are required for proper indoor air quality and ventilation in tight, manufactured houses and, in turn, an accurate estimate of the costs was omitted.</p>
<p>In general, the project impact was well-received among reviewers, recognizing its alignment with both DOE goals and project-specific goals. Reviewers complimented the project's contribution to standardizing energy-efficient design and construction practices within the manufactured housing industry. Since the project demonstrated existing technology as opposed to a new product, a reviewer predicted that market adoption would be more widespread. Several reviewers stressed the importance of informing both the building community and the consumer of the technology benefits. The positive impact on economically disadvantaged populations was also noted in relation to energy and cost savings in the homes. On the other hand, one reviewer was uncertain whether the impacts presented would be realized.</p>
<p>Reviewers approved of the current progress and applauded the team's successful implementation of its approach strategy. Many of the comments included reference to the significant results achieved during the project and the impact that the project would have moving forward. The team's attention to comfort and energy savings was highlighted as well as their stakeholder engagement. In terms of collaboration and coordination, reviewers were overwhelmingly positive with five out of the seven reviewers awarding the project an ""Outstanding."" The wide variety of partners including manufacturers, research laboratories, and other industry stakeholders was celebrated by most reviewers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers were satisfied with the project team's approach to demonstrate that unvented roofs with fibrous insulation are ineffective in cold climates and that unvented roofs with diffusion vents and interior vapor control may address this moisture issue. Two reviewers specifically commended the test hut approach for its excellent experimental design. However, at least one reviewer preferred that data be collected from actual homes that were experiencing the problems that this project seeks to understand and correct. Regarding the project's impact, most reviewers were similarly optimistic that this project would have a significant impact on program goals. These reviewers highlighted the cheaper insulation option and lower costs when compared to foam insulation as reasons for the potential positive impact on the market. One reviewer pointed to the potential to use this cheaper insulation method in retrofit projects. However, another reviewer cautioned that this impact will ultimately be driven by whether builders are willing to add insulation at roofline.</p>
<p>All reviewers commended the project team for its well-planned and thorough progress to date, noting the high-quality tests that had been performed and the actionable results that had been documented. Reviewers called out at least three findings that had already proved significant, including demonstrating that: 1) diffusion vents help control and prevent condensation, 2) fibrous insulation with unvented attics is calamitous, and 3) moisture cycling in blown in cellulose causes a lot of settling.</p>
<p>Almost all reviewers lauded the project team for engaging and collaborating with relevant stakeholders, including major insulation manufacturers and leaders in the insulation industry. Reviewers also praised the project team for sharing the results broadly through annual meetings, conference presentations, and trade associations. However, one reviewer was unclear how the advisory group was composed and advised the project team to include code enforcement officials and subcontractors affected by the results.</p>
<p>Most reviewers also believed that the project has been logically planned such that the remaining work will meet the&nbsp;project-specific goals. Some reviewers pondered whether the project goals have already been met and that whatever minimal testing remained would not reveal drastically different results (e.g., that spray foam is the best solution for this kind of roof). Other reviewers believed that despite the data already collected, important work remained to be completed, including analysis and recommendation. However, reviewers were unanimous in their belief that the project would be completed with the scheduled timeframe.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, reviewers approved of the project approach to demonstrate how to seal a building using an aerosol sprayer with the potential to&nbsp;impact&nbsp;new construction approaches, particularly for larger production builders. Reviewers praised the approach for successfully demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of the technology and that it can be applied at a variety of logical stages in the construction of a home and achieve successful results, as well as establishing a good plan of recruiting home builders to test this new technology. This is a solid opportunity to simplify (e.g., eliminate poly-sheet air barrier at the ceiling) and potentially save construction time with improved performance.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the impact on helping create more airtight homes is clear and there is good potential that the results of this research will lead to the adoption of this technology by leading-edge production builders. The impact will be significant when it is seen that the project produces a tighter, more energy-efficient home with little effort. However, one reviewer highlighted that the impact is not expected to be significant as builders and homeowners will have many questions about the effectiveness and soundness of the approach. Another reviewer expressed uncertainty whether the key contractor (Aeroseal) can control the market (i.e., secure intellectual property) and whether it has the capacity to keep both costs and scheduling competitive with other approaches and capitalize the scale up to meet potential demand.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that the project team has shown great progress. They have made excellent progress in testing two houses in California and two in Minnesota, and they have successfully proven the concept from a technical perspective. The team has maintained excellent control of the schedule, including field work (with multiple cooperating builders), analysis, and outreach, and there has been adoption by a builder. Next, they will finish and have a document that illustrates good practice and recommended procedures for this Aeroseal technology.</p>
<p>All reviewers praised the project for its exemplary collaboration and coordination in the industry. The reviewers provided many examples of this collaboration and coordination, including bringing nonparticipating builders to construction sites to witness implementation of the aerosealing process, giving presentations about the method and product at several national conferences, and getting all testing and blower door measurements for so many homes. One reviewer commented that the primary go-to-market strategy will be driven by the manufacturer and their franchisees leveraging research conducted in this project.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers recognized the success of the project, while also noting that there is still remaining project work to be done. The team has done a nice job in laying out a well-defined, bounded set of goals to test this cutting-edge technology, and they have gone beyond tasks in some cases for better outreach and more field house testing. Reviewers also noted the remaining work: end of construction testing, generating best practice documents, getting feedback from builders about this method as compared to the conventional approach, preparing installation guidelines, performing energy analysis, and disseminating the results.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most of the reviewers approved of the project approach to use smart thermostat data in a smart way to target utility incentive program outreach, circumventing traditional outreach methods in what is hoped to be a more targeted and accurate way. There is a clear challenge and the team has a promising method, that is technically sound, to leverage a technology that is already on its way to scaled deployment in the market (communicating thermostats) to target consumers with meaningful opportunities to improve their homes. However, two reviewers expressed concerns about the approach: success and final steps of the project assume that the targeting will increase energy audit uptakes, but there is no backup plan if this is not found in the market test &ndash; the sparse data used for modeling is worrisome; and this project may not be applicable to all American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) climatic zones.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the project is expected to contribute to program goals. Assuming the project-specific goals are met, this could ultimately lead&nbsp;to achievement of&nbsp;the program goal of improving&nbsp;existing building energy efficiency. One reviewer commented that a tool that enables program administrators and contractors to get a ""peek under the hood"" without going to the house is invaluable for reducing&nbsp;acquisition costs and project cycle times while increasing close rates, achievement of savings, and overall cost-effectiveness. However, reviewers highlighted that the project doesn't help overcome the challenge of why (besides energy savings) the buildings might want this benefit and this project is only specific to ASHRAE climate zones 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the project is on track and showing excellent progress. The team has made significant progress on the technical aspects of their algorithms, and have obtained preliminary data to check those algorithms. They are providing useful and accurate data to target utility energy-efficiency marketing programs for less cost, and they are well on their way to producing a tool that can be used in the broader market. One reviewer pointed out that there is concern on the validity of the statistical analysis of the R-value predicted versus CT R-value.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that the project has excellent stakeholder engagement, particularly with utilities. The strategic partnership with Eversource and National Grid is one of the key strengths of this project, and with more validation, they could seek other utility partners too. One reviewer highlighted that strategic collaboration and coordination to use private utility data is critical to maintaining confidence in the use of such data and will be essential moving forward.</p>
<p>The reviewers were divided on the degree to which the project has logically planned remaining work to meet the&nbsp;project-specific goals. Three reviewers agreed with the remaining project work, stating that remaining project work is well-planned and thoughtful in tying the project goals to program goals and the team seems on track to successfully complete the project and bring it to market. One reviewer highlighted that the team plans to spend the remainder of its time validating the approach through its partners. However, two reviewers voiced concern regarding the remaining work and noted that there are still several questions that need the attention of the project team prior to finalizing the modified grey-box model and there is no backup plan if the hypothesis of targeting increasing energy audit uptake is not proven.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the project approach is targeted, acceptable, and focused, with one reviewer praising the project for its excellent (consensus) experimental design. The project is well-designed to ensure research results translate into market-based practices and the approach to stakeholder engagement is a key element to the project's success and it appears to have been well-executed. However, one reviewer expressed concerns that it seems that continuous insulation (CI) will require custom details at the window interaction because of the many varieties of window-wall interfaces and it is not clear whether the detail at such interface has been the cause of lower than desirable levels of the use of CI.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the project will contribute to program goals, with an immediate and solid impact, because this project is targeted directly at solving a problem that could hinder the widescale deployment of high-R walls if left unresolved. The consensus process and excellent experimental design are likely to lead to a test procedure adequate for code adoption, which is demonstrably required for market acceptance and expansion. However, two reviewers disagreed on the extent of the project impact, stating that leaving out the air barrier connection in the testing protocol is a critical mistake that doesn't further DOE BTO program goals and because the result of the work will be mainly test data from tests for selected window-wall interface details, the impact will be very limited.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the project is progressing as expected and they have done good work on this complicated problem. The project is on track and the team has made strong progress working with multiple stakeholders to identify&nbsp;concerns and test accordingly to address those concerns. One reviewer highlighted that there is still major outstanding work to be completed, such as (a) proposed construction solutions after consensus from industry (this is a major task and contractors may not rely on instruction manuals) and (b) development of standardized testing (another formidable task that takes considerable time).</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that project staff demonstrated strategic collaboration or coordination with relevant stakeholders, with one reviewer stating that the stakeholder engagement process, including the impacted manufacturers from the beginning of the project, is a key strategy to the project's overall success in achieving real market impact. Another reviewer praised this project for being a model of proper collaboration, bringing together all the stakeholders and spending enough time (one year) just working out the appropriate test methods and test points. However, two reviewers pointed out gaps in the collaboration and coordination, including air barrier continuity testing, the manufactured home industry, and the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC).</p>
<p>In general, the reviewers agreed that the remaining work in the project plan is logical and on track, and they are substantially finished with the project. They have a clear path forward and mechanisms for industry to follow up with the development of testing framework. Two reviewers highlighted that important, time-consuming work remains to be done, including phase II testing and evaluation of results and developing a best practices manual (after consensus with industry/contractors).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers agreed that the project approach is sound. The project, which provides a way to help eliminate contaminants in a home from cooking in order to enable homes to be constructed more tightly for energy savings, has an approach that builds on and exploits the work of other Building America projects to identify and develop low-cost and reliable sensors and range hood&nbsp;capture efficiency. However, reviewers expressed concerns about the complexity of the control scheme and the assumption that the most viable answer is a control strategy that relies on sensing specific pollutant concentrations instead of a simpler control solution.</p>
<p>Reviewers were divided on the degree to which the project is&nbsp;expected to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;program goals, with two reviewers agreeing that the project addresses Building America's goals of improving indoor air quality in energy-efficient homes. The other reviewers were skeptical, stating that there is only an indirect link to the overall energy-efficiency goals and the proposed solution is overly complex. Reviewers were critical about a higher failure rate (working when needed and not turning on when not needed) and more energy expenditure from the fan running more.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that the project has shown great progress, and next steps will include testing and commercialization. Reviewers mostly agreed that the project is on track, but one reviewer stated that it is difficult to assess the project's progress because most information on the prototype was held as proprietary information. One reviewer critiqued the project that it seems like the project team came into the project with a pre-conceived notion of what the answer would be and it is limiting their creativity in exploring alternative solutions to the control strategy.</p>
<p>The reviewers unanimously approved of the project's collaboration, particularly with Broan, a major range hood manufacturer that will give them an avenue to making their development readily available in the marketplace. Collaboration and coordination are comprehensive and well-designed to achieve project goals working with and through project team members and stakeholders. One reviewer suggested future collaboration with ANSI because of their role as the standard setting body for oven performance.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers approved of the remaining project work, with many reviewers pointing out that field testing will be the next step, and two reviewers expressing optimism that the field tests will successfully mirror the performance from laboratory findings. The project is on track to commercialization and creating a marketable product. The only critique provided for remaining project work is that the time for customer field studies seems a little short.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers offered mixed opinions on this project's overall approach to overcoming barriers by using smart, low-cost sensors to measure humidity and optimize ventilation in homes located in hot-humid climates. Reviewer comments on the project team's approach ranged from ""excellent and thoughtful"" to ""reasonable and sound"" to one reviewer concluding that the approach ""may not lead to overcoming the challenges."" In addition, another reviewer expressed concern that the small sample size of buildings (four) made it difficult to draw conclusions regarding the approach. Similarly, most reviewers were hesitant to attribute this project as having a significant impact on program goals. Several reviewers described the impact as being limited because of several factors including: 1) perceived risk adoption by builders, 2) competition with other products, 3) limitation to ERV market, and 4) lack of direct links with manufacturers. However, despite the early stages and limited scope of the project, two other reviewers cited this project's impact &ndash; specifically its role in field validation &ndash; as being an important building block for larger-scale field studies in a potentially huge hot-humid builders' market. Another reviewer was optimistic that this project's improvements to BeOpt and collaboration with Senseware would also have a lasting impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consensus among reviewers was that, although the project team had encountered initial setbacks, the team has made significant progress on its project-specific goals. Only one reviewer (out of seven) was concerned that the team had not made enough progress to complete all of the goals within schedule. Similarly, most reviewers commended the project team for engaging in a high degree of coordination and collaboration with relevant stakeholders. Reviewers were impressed with the selection of industry partners, including Broan/Venmar and Beazer, and the inclusion of a public health group. This robust degree of coordination combined to generate a diverse project team with different perspectives.</p>
<p>Most reviewers believed that the project team was on pace to complete the remaining project work. However, two reviewers remained apprehensive that remaining data acquisition would creep into the time available to complete reporting and develop outreach materials, including important guidance documents for builders. They also noted that significant and time-consuming analysis remained to be done. The other five reviewers expressed no such doubts, though some acknowledged that there was still a lot of work to be done.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers were satisfied with this project team's approach to overcoming barriers and technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. Reviewers were overall supportive of an integrated, whole-house system that combines heating, cooling, and ventilation into a single package for low-load homes. One reviewer believed that the limited scope of the project was important because early success would lead to wider industry acceptance down the road. Similarly, another reviewer was optimistic that successful pilot implementation of this project would be in line with the result from the prototypes. Some reviewers conceded that more development would be required beyond the project in order to determine market readiness but were confident that this project's approach and subsequent documentation would lay the groundwork in a growing market.</p>
<p>Most reviewers were confident that if the project-specific goals were met, this project would contribute to program goals, including an overall improvement in indoor air quality and a reduction in energy usage. Two reviewers cited the affordable cost as a primary reason for this product's eventual success. However, reviewers offered some caveats that may affect the long-term impact of this project. Two reviewers noted that this product would need to be successfully commercialized and readily adopted by HVAC contractors. One of those reviewers also highlighted the need for building codes that require ventilation and HRVs. A different reviewer also noted that energy savings would be very dependent on the climate in which this technology is implemented, and thus significant percentages of residential energy may not be saved.</p>
<p>All reviewers commended the project team for its progress on project-specific goals and noted that ""significant"" progress had been made to date. One reviewer lauded the product's value proposition and believed it would prove useful for commercialization. Two reviewers believed that a significant amount of work remained to be done, including ""non-trivial engineering tasks."" Another reviewer would like to see cost studied in detail for actual implementation by contractors. However, the consensus among reviewers was that a lot of progress had been achieved on the prototype in a relatively short amount of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All reviewers believed that the project team had demonstrated a high degree of strategic collaboration and coordination with relevant stakeholders, including Mitsubishi and Therma-Stor. Reviewers were satisfied with the incorporation of key manufacturers on this project and lauded the team for its outreach with contractors, builders, and other industry groups. One reviewer specifically highlighted the different types of media employed by the team to achieve this high level of outreach. Similarly, most reviewers believed that the team had logically planned its remaining work for the remaining timeframe and that this would largely be focused on refining the prototype and reporting results. Only one reviewer expressed concern, noting that he/she was confused by the change of plans to install a unit in an office rather than a home.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project approach was thoughtful and well-designed. At least three reviewers believed that the project offered a fresh and unique approach to designed-in building construction that would prove foundational in future work in this field. Furthermore, most reviewers were optimistic that the project could prove impactful in contributing to program goals, with two reviewers highlighting the reduction in labor costs. However, some reviewers expressed concern that the current level of funding and industry cost share committed to this concept would not be enough to move the dial forward and that current economies of scale would not make this viable for smaller-scale builders. One reviewer suggested that the project needs to demonstrate adoption outside of the pilot in order to expand the impact of this project.</p>
<p>Most reviewers agreed that the project has made significant progress despite the novel approach to building construction being implemented and the inherent complexities of new home construction. However, one reviewer implied that this project will not be completed when funding runs out. Another reviewer suggested that this project could lead to a follow-up project that engaged more builders in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reviewers commended this project for its overall collaboration and coordination with key stakeholders, citing the strong partnerships that were formed with large home builders and the wider building community. Two reviewers were particularly impressed with the level of buy-in that was achieved to enable builders to accept significant changes to their construction techniques. However, two different reviewers suggested that the project &ndash; having demonstrated proof of concept &ndash; should be expanded to even more builders, specifically those in the manufactured homes industry. Overall, most reviewers believed the remaining project work was on track to be completed within the timeframe. However, one reviewer expressed concern that it would be ""impossible"" to complete the plan in the given timeframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers were split on their opinions of the project's approach, but three reviewers agreed that the team is working to solve a very challenging problem. These reviewers expressed many concerns and emphasized that there is too much risk involved in decoupling a risky roof&nbsp;insulation strategy from the age and quality of the roofing material and material installation. It is unclear if they were prepared to ""push the limit"" to see where failure occurred, and what to do if the insulation job failed. There is a great deal more field work needed to prove this concept, and it is unclear on the final foam composition. Two reviewers praised the approach for being well-laid-out.</p>
<p>Two of the reviewers praised the project's focus on existing buildings and homes, as this is an area of great potential to reduce energy consumption. However, many of the reviewers noted points of concern about the project's impact, particularly the risk this approach represents to the long-term durability of roof assemblies, environmental risks of foam, and uncertainty of market size. In addition, this project is only for cathedral ceilings; they are still working on flat roofs.</p>
<p>All reviewers generally agreed that the project is on track and showing good progress. The project team has shown itself to be disciplined and creative in solving practical installation issues related to installing&nbsp;closed cell spray foam in existing roof assemblies, exceeding their project-specific goals. However, reviewers voiced their uncertainty about what the end result will look like, if the team considered typical ""brownstone"" roofs with larger 2-3 foot cavities and how best&nbsp;to treat those, and if the foam is replaced by a new low GWP foam and whether that will affect the process, or how much rework would be necessary.</p>
<p>Many reviewers praised the project's collaboration with a manufacturer (CertainTeed) and the project's use of a council of contractors. The partners and stakeholders the team has engaged are good choices and should be helpful in crafting an ultimate solution. Two reviewers provided suggestions on improving project collaboration and coordination: a broader reach within the building science community may be warranted to fully vet risks and benefits and it would be good to have more than one contractor involved.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the project team has logically planned remaining work to meet the&nbsp;project-specific goals. The project is on track and remaining project work is expected to be completed, but reviewers did suggest additional remaining work, such as moisture monitoring and a way to provide this information to more practitioners. Two reviewers pointed out that more field testing is needed to prove this concept.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agreed the project contributes to overcoming barriers to energy efficiency and moisture control, and that the project's approach is valid. In addition, one reviewer noted that some reported results did not meet ASHRAE standards and another reviewer felt more information about the level of interest of manufacturers and homebuilders, as well as pre-market testing, is needed.</p>
<p>Reviewers stated that the project will contribute to program technical goals, but also emphasized that adoption of the technical advances that result from the project will need to be supported by measures ranging from educating homeowners to utility incentives to standards and codes. One reviewer questioned the value of enhanced dehumidification and noted that the benefits of ventilation extend beyond dehumidification.</p>
<p>The reviewers found the project is progressing well toward its goals, and two reviewers specifically highlighted that the project should produce results that can impact the market. One reviewer felt that work related to control protocols is scheduled too late in the project timeline.</p>
<p>The reviewers all rated the project highly for its collaboration efforts, which range across private sector, industry association, and government entities. Three reviewers agreed the project was on track to meet its goals, but one reviewer felt the modeling work should have been done first. Lastly, one other reviewer felt the project plan does not support project results that will impact the market.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The approach for the project to embed energy efficiency and distributed energy resources (DERs) into advanced manufacturing of buildings was generally well-received. Several reviewers applauded the team's partnerships with the modular construction industry and cited this collaboration as the predominant factor that would lead to the project's ultimate success. While reviewers appreciated that the team took the perspective of another industry, two of the reviewers expressed concern with maintaining the industry's engagement and disseminating results and information. The established industry advisory group was also mentioned in coordination with the offsite construction factory partnerships.</p>
<p>Reviewers disagreed slightly about the potential contribution that the project could have on DOE's energy-efficiency goals. The majority of reviewers recognized that offsite construction was an emerging trend, but their comments differed regarding the degree of energy savings and BTO's role in the industry's near-term growth. One reviewer noted that a baseline manufactured building will likely be more energy efficient than a building built on-site. The reviewer continued by explaining that the metric to consider in the project should be the ""marginal improvement between standard practice manufactured/modular buildings and the integrated solution this project is intended to develop.""</p>
<p>In terms of the team's progress and collaboration with its partners, reviewers found the project to be well-thought-through and progressing as expected. Several reviewers commended the engagement with stakeholders with one reviewer highlighting the three secured partnership agreements as confirmation of the significant progress the team has made in the short period of time. It was recommended that the team expand their collaboration to include more factories, contractors, architects, and engineers. Also, reviewers suggested partnering with specific project groups and organizations in order to broaden stakeholder engagement.</p>
<p>The reviewers raised multiple unanswered questions about the project's remaining work and provided additional comments for the team to consider moving forward. One reviewer inquired about the presented flowchart idea that would document the manufacturing process and was uncertain whether the process would be applicable to more than one manufacturer. Another reviewer proposed using the Better Buildings format to model the development of a peer network so that the factories could work together on energy improvements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers were divided on the degree to which the project's approach contributes to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks, but multiple reviewers agreed that there will be challenges in preparing this technology for the market. The team did a good job realizing that the timeline needed to be extended, but they still have more work to do with further development of project plans and implementation and more demonstrations that build on the lessons learned from the first pilots. Two reviewers expressed concern that these deep energy-efficiency retrofits may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>Overall, the reviewers were cautiously optimistic about the project's impact, with multiple reviewers questioning the specific segment of the market that this project addresses. The impact is potentially massive, assuming cost is on par with, or less than, conventional over-cladding options, as a revolutionary way to retrofit existing multifamily buildings. The project is ambitious, but one reviewer highlighted that the project may not achieve the stated impact owing to (a) complexities in system integration, sizing, optimal location, and how this integrated system works in conjunction with existing systems (controls) and (b) an integrated system that is/may not be zero-energy.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers agreed that the project has made progress on specific tasks such as gaining partners and finding gap funding. However, they have not yet fully secured a construction project, the lack of an integrated MEP system is concerning, and there is a challenge of ""at what cost"" when at such a small scale today. One reviewer determined that, given the progress to date, it is too early to tell the degree to which the project has met project goals.</p>
<p>The reviewers all agreed that the project has a strong team of partnerships, with good collaboration and coordination. The project has well-rounded stakeholder involvement, particularly with the European manufacturers, since&nbsp;they have already figured out how to achieve scale on many of these products. One reviewer suggested improving the coordination to complete the project within the timeframe and within the budget allotted.</p>
<p>Many reviewers approved of the project's remaining work, but multiple reviewers were critical of the timeline and noted the lack of time to monitor adequately to truly gauge the effectiveness of the process. The plan is reasonable, with two pilot projects selected, but remaining project work hinges on successful fulfillment of two RFPs for panelized wall assemblies and a factory zero integrated climate energy module. Reviewers highlighted additional issues such as there is an identified need for gap financing for the initial projects, when manufacturing and installation are not yet at scale, the integrated system may not be zero energy ready, and the project is currently running over budget.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Overall, the reviewers agreed that the project has a sound approach and research plan. The project's approach, going out and measuring real homes with extensive instrumentation, is straightforward, on track, and the best way to see how real homes are performing. The information gathered will significantly add to the building science community's knowledge base of the current state of IAQ and ventilation in newer homes, but one reviewer highlighted that it is unclear that&nbsp;the short-term field monitoring will translate accurately as a proxy for&nbsp;long-term performance of these systems over the course of a year.</p>
<p>In general, the reviewers agreed that the project is critical in helping to understand how homes are performing and ensuring that very tight, energy-efficient homes have good IAQ and critical in collecting data to achieve overall program goals. Developing a field-validated moisture balance model that ventilation standards can reference for hot-humid climates is an important step toward enhancing our current standards to&nbsp;make&nbsp;them more relevant for humid climates. The impact is significant, and the project team's effort is commendable, but one reviewer emphasized that the link between project goals and program goals is not direct, but it is no less important.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that project progress is on track. The team has made good progress and they are likely to achieve project-specific goals. However, one reviewer noted that they still have a good amount of work to do in the locations outside of Florida and hopefully they will be able to find enough homes in other states as well.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers suggested additional communities that the project team can include outreach to: HERS rater community, Gainesville community (Gainesville, Alachua County is Radon Zone 2), and builder community. Reviewers generally agreed that project collaboration and coordination are good, and the team has been coordinating with the right entities. They have additional funding from ASRHAE for lab validation of more homes and researchers are working with other national labs (LBNL, PNNL) to build up the database nationwide on this important topic.</p>
<p>Reviewers agree that despite the early delay with getting started and working with IBR, remaining project work is on track and will lead to the desired results, once analyzed. One reviewer commented that remaining project work is expected to truly round out the pool of data gathered to be able to see various trends and to prove the data gathering protocols, and the validated data can then be used to inform future standards and technology development. The project team will achieve the project-specific goals within the timeframe.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers generally approved of the project approach, an early stage research project to analyze and make the case for supplemental mini-split systems. They have a sound experimental and implementation plan, and the midstage progress of the project means&nbsp;the project team likely has time to sort out the necessary aspects/components needed to achieve enough savings to make the proposed system a viable and relevant option. One reviewer suggested that the project team help familiarize people with mini-splits before they completely phase out their central system.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that this project addresses the Building America goals of reducing space conditioning energy consumption (by 10%) while improving thermal comfort. This impact is well-quantified, with large market potential, since commercially available multisystem controls are necessary to achieve the widescale goals of reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, one reviewer pointed out that the actual impact once the project is complete may be limited to a relatively small subset of homes seeking deep energy retrofits and having a central air conditioning system that isn't ready to be replaced.</p>
<p>Reviewers unanimously agreed that the project is showing good progress and that progress is logical and on track. The project was applauded for an excellent job of meeting its goals. However, one reviewer expressed unease that the project appears to have a fair amount of work remaining prior to the expected end date of September 2019.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers praised the project's collaboration and coordination, particularly with Mitsubishi. Reviewers suggested increasing broader engagement as the project nears completion and expanding their direct stakeholder involvement. Another reviewer commented that they need to more actively engage with equipment (heat pump) manufacturers if they are not already.</p>
<p>All reviewers agreed that the remaining project work is logically planned and on track for completion. One reviewer noted that there is a fair amount of effort remaining in the short time until the project is scheduled to be completed. However, other reviewers praised the project for a sound schedule, plans that are anticipated to produce the desired results, clearly defining the problem and plan, and coordinating buildings with both mini-splits and central systems.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers were impressed by this project's approach to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. There was near unanimous consent that the thoughtful, methodical, and well-balanced approach employed by this project team has contributed to its ""long and successful track record."" With regards to mitigating risks, one reviewer was particularly supportive of the harmonization of the Home Energy Score (HES) tool with EnergyPlus and Open Studio SDK. In a similar vein, another reviewer cited the harmonization of HES and the HERS Index Score as an important step in overcoming technical barriers. The only critical comment regarding this project's approach concerned the adoption of data validation functions that mirrored actions already employed by the market and the failure to effectively communicate this effort with stakeholders. Regarding the degree to which this project is expected to contribute to program goals, reviewers believed that Home Energy Score will prove critical to standardizing the measurement of efficiency in existing homes and expanding the number of energy-efficient single-family homes. However, one reviewer expressed concern that the project metrics are focused more on communicating information than on reaching the program goal of 40% energy use reduction in residential buildings.</p>
<p>Most reviewers commented that this project is successfully meeting its project-specific goals by increasing traction (e.g., by increasing the number of partners, scores, and APIs) and expanding its audience. Two reviewers specifically remarked upon the work being done to attract state and local governments and the tremendous potential these stakeholders represent in making the Home Energy Score a national, federally managed standard. However, some reviewers noted that there are even more opportunities to expand adoption of the tool, including with appraisers and the mortgage industry.</p>
<p>Nearly all reviewers were impressed by the project team's collaboration and coordination with relevant stakeholders, with one reviewer going so far as to state, ""the collaboration is perhaps the strongest of any project seen at the Peer Review."" Specifically, reviewers were excited by the sheer breadth of the number of stakeholders involved in this project, including the Department, three national laboratories, two private-sector companies, local governments, NGOs, utilities, and software providers. However, one reviewer emphasized that more collaboration and coordination&nbsp;was&nbsp;needed, and that this coordination should focus on standardization.</p>
<p>Overall, most reviewers were satisfied with the remaining project work, though at least two reviewers were concerned with issues regarding utility data accuracy and integration within in the HES tool. Many reviewers also offered insight on where they envision strategic opportunities with the remaining project work, including integration with SEED; integration of electrification, demand flexibility, grid-interactivity, and/or EVs; and the development of a systemized process for addressing technical questions (e.g., a ""help desk""). Additionally, reviewers noted the importance of market transition plans and increased stakeholder coordination as the team moves toward maintenance mode.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team recognized reviewer feedback on communicating updates to software providers, adding that they will ensure that partner implementers are included on related communications earlier for their input and awareness while also maintaining the integrity of data validation efforts on behalf of DOE. The team also agreed with reviewers that noted additional opportunities for expanded adoption of the tool (i.e., with appraisers, the mortgage industry, etc.) and supported one reviewer's recommendation to update NREL's assessment of HES vs. actual utility data to improve accuracy and reliability of the tool and its outputs, and will address these items accordingly.</p>",Building America and Residential Research

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Reviewers were overall very supportive of this project's approach to overcoming barriers, technical challenges, and mitigating project risks. Two reviewers lauded the long-term, ongoing approach taken by this project team and the supplemental role this team plays in supporting other Building America teams. Most reviewers believed this project serves key functions in both the collection and dissemination of information on indoor air quality (IAQ) in homes and the development of standards for the IAQ industry. One reviewer also commended the team for taking on a leadership role in establishment IAQ codes and standards. Most reviewers also agreed that this project has been impactful in its contribution to meeting program goals, with two reviewers highlighting the project team's role in developing low-cost sensors for IAQ measurement. However, one reviewer was keen on understanding what approaches the team uses to achieve such a low cost of implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding progress on project-specific goals, reviewers were impressed with the work done to date. Two reviewers specifically called out the studies completed on developing smart ventilation systems. However, one reviewer expressed concern that the remaining FY19 workload would not allow appropriate evaluation time for the smart ventilation algorithms being developed. Overall, the sentiment was strong among reviewers that the project had made significant progress, with the theme of IAQ standards development cropping up again, specifically as it relates to RESNET 380 and the ASHRAE IAQ section.</p>
<p>There was near unanimous agreement among reviewers that the project team has been extremely effective at achieving strategic collaboration and coordination with relevant stakeholders. Reviewers commended the team for working with industry partners, and two reviewers specifically called out the collaboration as ""exemplary."" Most reviewers also believed that that remaining work for this project team was reasonable. However, one reviewer was again concerned that the current timeline did not leave enough time for evaluation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers were generally supportive of the project team's approach, believing the concept of integrated window and wall panels to be a successful means for preventing infiltration and improving sealing. However, some of the reviewers outlined potential areas of concern including the high cost of integration into new construction and the overall accessibility of this market. One reviewer also recommended that more could have been done at the onset of this project to review existing literature on this subject or coordinate with manufacturers regarding potential barriers.</p>
<p>Reviewers were more mixed on the potential impact of this project to contribute to program goals, with responses ranging from a large impact to a midlevel impact to unclear. At least two reviewers believed there to be a high-potential impact if the project can demonstrate feasibility and model flanking loss between window wall interfaces. Again, reviewers expressed concern with the potential market for this project. One reviewer believed the market will be limited to multifamily construction, while another reviewer held that the approach requires pre-fabrication construction and is thus limited in scope of buildings.</p>
<p>All reviewers noted that this project is in the early stages and thus were hesitant to measure its progress to date. Yet two reviewers were confident that progress had already been demonstrated in this early stage. One reviewer recommended that this project be reviewed at the next Peer Review. In addition, most reviewers believed that the project team could do more to coordinate and collaborate with relevant stakeholders in the residential homebuilding sector. One reviewer commented that the team's composition leaned too heavily toward technical engineers while neglecting building construction experts. Another reviewer recommended that the team incorporate other window manufacturers, such as SAGE or View. Most reviewers did not comment on the degree to which the project has logically planned remaining work to meet the&nbsp;project-specific goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team noted reviewer comments requesting more discussion on the techno-economic analysis (TEA), and although such analysis is being conducted throughout the project, they will better emphasize this in future project evaluations. Similarly, the project lead will also consider more technical advisory group (TAG) assessments during early R&amp;D phases of the project.</p>
<p>The PI also noted that some comments were specific to building ventilation and thin glass triple-glazing technology. While this particular project focuses on window airtightness and moisture resiliency, the project lead acknowledged that the results are expected to benefit other applications, and this will be emphasized in the conclusions of the project. Also, because the project can lead to modeling flanking loss between the window-wall interface &ndash; and because this is not accounted for in energy models &ndash; the team will consider and report on this as it would help more accurately model energy performance of buildings.</p>
<p>The project team also stressed that the work plan is continuously updated to reflect current project developments. In response to other reviewer comments, the PI added that there is large area VIG glazing ready for trial, and that frame adoption is being considered as well. Moreover, issues associated with the transportation of the system are being investigated.</p>",Building America and Residential Research

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers concluded that the project approach was well-designed and that conducting field validation for a next generation, low global warming potential (GWP) heat pump water heater (HPWH) would prove useful toward contributing to program goals. The reviewers believed that a low GWP refrigerant coupled with a high-efficiency water heater could be valuable product with a high potential for energy savings. However, one reviewer commented that he/she would have preferred if more modeling had been performed by the team. Another reviewer conceded that it is still unclear that the project's HPWH will be any more efficient than existing water heaters but was optimistic about incorporation of the low GWP refrigerant as a phase-out of high GWP refrigerant.</p>
<p>Despite being in its early stages, most reviewers believed that the project was on track and had made significant progress toward meeting its goals. In addition to the modeling activity, two reviewers highlighted the real-world field testing across a range of building sizes and applications. Furthermore, most reviewers were satisfied with the degree to which this project team is collaborating with relevant stakeholders. Two reviewers commended the team for including a leading manufacturer in HPWHs, A.O. Smith, as a part of the team. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers commented that the project is well-planned but that significant work remains to be done, including building prototypes, performing field tests, and analyzing and comparing test performance data. One reviewer would also like the team to add performance&nbsp;evaluation&nbsp;of HPWHs at standard rating conditions. Another reviewer believes that the team should look at the options of further cycle enhancements (e.g., advanced cycles).</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team acknowledged that several reviewer comments were directed toward a related project (32226s &ndash; Max Tech Efficiency Electric HPWH with Low-GWP Halogenated Refrigerant), which focuses on the design and development of the Max Tech HPWH equipment that is utilized in this Max Tech HPWH Field Test project. As a result, the team will better clarify the scope of this field test project and its related counterpart in future project evaluations. Furthermore, the project team emphasized that the complementary BTO project scope includes laboratory testing at standard rating conditions to evaluate the uniform energy factor (UEF) of the proposed designs, directly addressing one reviewer comment on including this in the field test project scope.</p>
<p>Per reviewer feedback, the PI will also emphasize that the field evaluations of this project will allow for an efficiency assessment of the Max Tech HPWH at both controlled research homes and occupied field studies, which will inform the impact analysis based on the HPWH performance established in this study. Moreover, one task in this field test project is to perform lifecycle cost and climate performance calculations for both the baseline and Max Tech HPWH to help evaluate the cost-effectiveness and environmental benefits of this technology, in addition to examining different ducting configurations and non-energy-related impacts.</p>
<p>Another complementary project (14119 &ndash; Technology Integration) is exploring the load-shifting capabilities of HPWHs for the electric grid using an established grid interface and demand response protocol. Although the Max Tech HPWH Field Test project is focused on the system's efficiency impact, a load-shifting characterization of the baseline and Max Tech HPWH prototype (to the extent possible) will be performed in the aforementioned research homes.</p>",Building America and Residential Research

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>The reviewers agreed that the approach is significant in adding to the building science and HVAC communities' knowledge base of the current state of the IAQ and ventilation effectiveness in newer homes. This project has an excellent approach design and will overcome technical challenges related to IAQ. Reviewers praised the team's approach for testing a large number of homes and actually going out and measuring real homes with extensive instrumentation.</p>
<p>Overall, reviewers agreed that this project is critical for understanding how homes are performing and ensuring that very tight, energy-efficient homes have good&nbsp;IAQ. The project will likely contribute to program goals, but first, as one reviewer pointed out, a baseline of IAQ is needed. However, one reviewer argued that the link between project goals and program goals is not direct because it seems assumptions are made that systems are generally installed and functioning correctly, but that is clearly not the case, so the assumptions need to be adjusted based on the reality of the data being gathered and other measures need to be implemented to ultimately achieve program goals.</p>
<p>Reviewers generally agreed that the project is on track. Progress to-date is good and the project is expected to achieve project-specific goals. One reviewer highlighted that there is still a good deal of homes to cover and work will need to be done to determine the best ways to analyze the data and present the results.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers praised the project for being a well-coordinated effort. The project team has excellent collaboration and coordination with stakeholders and a large group of expert partners. Three reviewers suggested additional stakeholders and partners to involve: manufacturers of HVAC equipment, homebuilders, the HERS rater community, more code adoption groups, and the builder industry.</p>
<p>Most of the reviewers agreed that the remaining project work is on track. The project will meet the project-specific goals within the timeframe and the validated data from this project can eventually be used to inform future standards and technology development. One reviewer expressed concerns that the team still has a fair amount of homes on which to capture data and they will need a broad set of data to get meaningful results.</p>

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>Most reviewers approved of the approach for this project and noted the aim to study load shifting with HP water heaters to strengthen the alignment between energy use and renewable energy production. One reviewer recognized that this approach is a big effort, while another reviewer stated that it is realistic and promising. Another reviewer argued that the major stakeholder should be the public, and since the primary goal of utilities is to sell electricity, developing this platform to be controlled by utilities is a significant oversight.</p>
<p>Multiple reviewers recognized this project's potential impact on increasing energy savings and renewable energy use. One reviewer praised the project's impact for its great potential. However, one reviewer cautioned that the focus of this program&nbsp;should be rethought as it may be driving grid interaction in a direction that will not achieve long-term public objectives.</p>
<p>Two reviewers highlighted that the team has identified&nbsp;regions offering the greatest potential for connected HP water heaters. The project is well-executed so far, and they have made good progress. In addition to these comments, one reviewer expressed skepticism if overall energy or user costs will be saved, since the project is specifically aimed at reducing utilities' costs.</p>
<p>In general, reviewers recognized the project's collaboration and coordination with utilities, and one reviewer suggested that seeking the utilities' cooperation with other potential alternative sources of demand limiting&nbsp;will provide insight into where their interests really are. Three reviewers agreed that they have a good collaboration team. The project led by PNNL has significant collaboration and coordination with ORNL, BPA, PGE, NEEA, and Duke Energy.</p>
<p>Two reviewers agreed that remaining tasks and efforts are focused on completing a smart-learning algorithm to optimize load use for individual water heaters. The project is well-planned, and they are into the final phase of the project. One reviewer strongly recommended that they find partners beyond utilities and focus on partnering with utilities to develop tariffs that allow the full measure of the potential savings to be reflected in demand shifting.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team acknowledged reviewer concerns that utility involvement in the project may lead to approaches in which connected HPWHs would benefit utilities disproportionately more than consumers. The PI noted that HPWHs can save 60% of annual energy use for water heating compared to electric-resistance water heaters, amounting to an average of $340 in annual consumer savings (according to the DOE test procedure, using the national average electricity price). Although the presentation was focused on current demand response efforts and related interactions with utility partners, PNNL and DOE engage with the full spectrum of government, academic, utility, and non-governmental organizations that research and implement HPWH programs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the team added that by demonstrating that HPWHs are a viable technology to reduce peak load, utilities may justify promoting HPWHs in their demand response programs. Showing the extent to which connected HPWHs can shift loads can also help utilities better utilize HPWH technology in strategies to increase integration of renewable energy sources.</p> <p>Per reviewer comments on HPWH energy-saving performance in cold climates and impacts on home HVAC systems, recent research shows little interaction with HVAC systems for most water heater installations.</p>",Building America and Residential Research

<h4>Brief Summary of Reviewer Comments</h4>
<p>In general, reviewers found the approach to the Validation Studies of High-R Windows project well-thought-out in order to achieve the team's goals. One reviewer stated that the project approach would mitigate risks and help the team overcome the technical challenges and barriers. It was noted that the supply-push and demand-pull strategy was likely to solve the previous issues regarding triple-pane integration. While a reviewer appreciated the field study and testing plan, they posed multiple questions for the project team on cost, safety, and design of the thin triple-pane window technology.</p>
<p>Reviewer comments on the project impact were overwhelmingly postive with three out of the four reviewers rating the project as ""Outstanding."" The contribution to DOE goals, if successful, was described as tremendous with the possibility of a large impact on energy use at a low cost. Several reviewers stressed that affordability would be key for market adoption, while one reviewer noted that it was critical that the thin triple-insulating glass unit (IGU) could be inserted into existing frames. In addition, the fact that the technology could be adopted without relying on himan invervention versus attachements was also highlighted.</p>
<p>In terms of project progress and collaboration, reviewers were generally complimentary, but provided suggestions for areas of improvement. One of the recommendations was for the team to expand the study into more extreme climate zones. Another reviewer commented that they were ""concerned that large window manufacturers will not be willing to adapt lines for thin glass handling."" The reviewer continued by remarking that this issue might inhibit large-scale adoption and was reiterated in a later comment. On the other hand, the remaining reviewers applauded the team's stakeholder engagement and their partners' involvement with the planning and experimental design of the project. Reviewers also mentioned that the project team was planning to recruit and pursue additional partnerships including utilities.</p>
<h4>Program Response</h4>
<p>The project team shared reviewer concerns regarding manufacturer's willingness to adapt lines to accommodate thin glass. As a result, the team is leveraging strong engagement between LBNL and large manufacturers (i.e., Andersen Windows) and is focusing a significant effort to demonstrate the advantages of this product to their customers, such as builders. The PI also recognizes that affordability will be a major factor for increasing demand and is hence working closely with field testing and manufacturing partners (i.e., Alpen and Kensington) to develop lower-cost vinyl-framed thin triples for field demonstrations.</p>
<p>The project team also noted the lack of tempered thin triple glass has been identified as a potential market barrier by builders in the initial market analyses, and hence is prioritizing the integration of safety glazing in their research by examining various temperable glass options that could be affordably integrated into the thin-triple design.</p>",Building America and Residential Research
