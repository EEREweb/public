Shared Automated Vehicle Fleet Operations for First-Mile Last-Mile Transit Connections with Dynamic Pooling,"Shared Automated Vehicles (SAVs) have the potential to promote transit ridership by providing efficient first-mile last-mile (FMLM) connections through reduced operational costs to fleet providers and lower out-of-pocket costs to riders. To help plan for a future of integrated mobility, this paper investigates the impacts of SAVs serving FMLM connections, as a mode that provides flexibility in access/egress decisions and is well coordinated with train station schedules. To achieve this objective, a novel dynamic pooling algorithm was introduced to match SAVs with riders while coordinating the riders' arrival times at the light-rail station to a known train schedule. Microsimulations of SAVs and travelers throughout two central Austin neighborhoods show how larger service areas, higher levels of SAV demand, and longer arrival times between successive trains require larger SAV fleet sizes and higher SAV utilization rates to deliver close traveler wait times. Four-person SAVs appear to perform similar to 6-seat SAVs but will cost less to provide. Using a dynamic pooling algorithm tightly coordinated with train arrivals (every 15 min) delivers 87% of travelers to their stations in time to catch the next train, while uncoordinated assignments deliver just 58% of travelers in time.

Innovative Scenarios for Modeling Intra-City Freight Delivery,"There has been a shift in the focus of freight modeling to the short-haul (or last-mile) due to an increase in online shopping. This study considers innovative freight delivery modes and multi-modal shifts, especially for the last-mile portion of intra-city freight delivery. For this study, GPS data were obtained from a truck fleet from a major parcel delivery company's depot near Columbus, Ohio and used to develop a freight delivery demand estimation model. Freight delivery tours were modeled in TransCAD and used to develop scenarios to incorporate various modal shifts to compare energy usage in kilowatt-hour estimates. Innovative modes of freight delivery were considered for the scenarios and were compared to a class six truck: electric class six trucks, electric delivery vans, parcel delivery lockers, drones, and electric passenger vehicles. Initial findings suggest that electric trucks reduce energy usage when the majority of miles traveled are in the long-haul, or stem portion of the route. Parcel delivery lockers reduced energy usage in suburban areas, especially those with large neighborhoods with cul-de-sacs. The findings from this study were intended to provide decision makers, both in government and industry, with information to consider when determining suitable alternatives for energy-efficient intra-city freight transport.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198219300247
Implementation of Model Predictive Control Into Closed-Loop Micro-Traffic Simulation for Connected Automated Vehicle,"Connected automated vehicles can utilize and share driving information with other vehicles and infrastructure in real time. Applying plentiful vehicle-driving data enhances the safety, mobility and performance of connected automated vehicles. Adaptive cruise control, one of the connected automated vehicle achievements, optimizes the speed in a constrained environment to achieve the best fuel economy while maintaining the safety of the vehicle. Model predictive control is widely used to achieve both fuel savings and robustness. It is important to validate the performance, robustness and implementability of model predictive control under real-world conditions that reflect the features of connected automated vehicle driving. In this research, model predictive control using quadratic programming and dynamic programming was implemented in a newly developed micro-traffic simulation program. That program, RoadRunner, can simulate the various driving conditions such as intersection status, speed limit, and grade of the road. RoadRunner is based on a forward-looking vehicle simulation tool, Autonomie, which has various types of configurations and validated vehicle models based on vehicle dynamics that make the simulation more reliable. As a result, the controllers show 3-5 % fuel savings accompanying the applicability to the real world driving.",Argonne National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896319306561
Hazard-Based Model of Activity Generation Using Vehicle Trajectory Data,"The primary contribution of the paper lies in using vehicle trajectory data from Ann Arbor along with multiple other data sources for developing a hazard-based activity generation model. The different category of data used in the analysis include - (i) vehicle trajectory data (VTD), (ii) American Census Survey (ACS), (iii) land use data, (iv) household travel survey (HTS) data, and (v) smart location data from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Home and work are identified as the two most frequently visited locations from the VTD and validated against land use categories of the region. Next a random utility-based model is developed using HTS data to identify other activity purposes as a function of the polynomials of distance from home, activity duration and departure time. The developed model is then applied to identify the non-home activity purposes in the VTD. Demographic and accessibility information are appended to the VTD from ACS and smart location databases respectively. The final database is then used to develop a hazard-based activity generation model.",Argonne National Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920306165

Optimal Charging Management and Infrastructure Planning for Free-Floating Shared Electric Vehicles,"Recently, major car-sharing service providers have begun to include electric vehicles (EVs) in free-floating car-sharing fleets. For these EVs, downtime due to charging, including time spent traveling to and waiting in queues at charging stations in a sparse charging infrastructure network, is a major barrier to sustainable operation. An intuitive solution to overcome this barrier is to increase the number of fast-charging stations in the fleet service area. This paper studies the relationship between fleet vehicle downtime and the number of charging stations by modeling the fleet operations of a major car-sharing service provider. An integer programming model is developed that jointly optimizes charging station allocation, in terms of the number and location of charging stations, and the assignment of EVs to charging stations. Case study results showed that fleet vehicle charging time comprises 72-75% of the total downtime spent on charging trips. This indicates that charging time, as opposed to travel time or waiting time, is the dominant component of total fleet downtime for charging. The study also shows that by adding 5-20 new charging stations reduces total fleet downtime and travel time during charging trips by 2-4% and 26-49%, respectively. Although adding new charging stations to the fleet service area reduces total charging trip travel time significantly, it does not reduce total downtime significantly. Results also show that if the EV battery state of the charge (SOC) threshold-below which a charging trip is initiated-is less than 18%, not all EVs in the car-sharing fleet can be charged using the existing direct current fast chargers (DCFCs) in the fleet's service area. This implies that adequate charging infrastructure coverage is required to ensure that EVs of a given range can operate in the car-sharing fleet.",Idaho National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361920918312537
"Travel and Energy Implications of Ridesourcing Service in Austin, Texas","This paper identifies major aspects of ridesourcing services provided by Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) which influence vehicles miles traveled (VMT) and energy use. Using detailed data on approximately 1.5 million individual rides provided by RideAustin in Austin Texas, we quantify the additional miles TNC drivers travel: before beginning and after ending their shifts, to reach a passenger once a ride has been requested, and between consecutive rides (all of which is referred to as deadheading); and the relative fuel efficiency of the vehicles that RideAustin drivers use compared to the average vehicle registered in Austin. We conservatively estimate that TNC drivers commute to and from their service areas accounts for 19% of the total ridesourcing VMT. In addition, we estimate that TNC drivers drove 55% more miles between ride requests within 60?min of each other, accounting for 26% of total ridesourcing VMT. Vehicles used for ridesourcing are on average two miles per gallon more fuel efficient than comparable light-duty vehicles registered in Austin, with twice as many are hybrid-electric vehicles. New generation battery electric vehicles with 200 miles of range would be able to fulfill 90% of full-time drivers' shifts on a single charge. We estimate that the net effect of ridesourcing on energy use is a 41-90% increase compared to baseline, pre-TNC, personal travel.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361920918309878?via%3Dihub=
"Describing the Users: Understanding Adoption of and Interest in Shared, Electrified, and Automated Transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area","Emerging technologies and services stand poised to transform the transportation system, with large implications for energy use and mobility. The degree and speed of these impacts depend largely on who adopts these innovations and how quickly. Leveraging data from a novel survey of San Francisco Bay Area residents, we analyze adoption patterns for shared mobility, electrified vehicle technologies, and vehicle automation. We find that ride-hailing and adaptive cruise control have penetrated the market more extensively than have electrified vehicles or car-sharing services. Over half of respondents have adopted or expressed interest in adopting all levels of vehicle automation. Overall, there is substantial potential for market growth for the technologies and services we analyzed. Using county fixed effects regressions, we investigate which individual and location-level factors correlate to adoption and interest. We find that, although higher-income people are disproportionately represented among current adopters of most new technologies and services, low- to middle-income people are just as likely to have adopted pooled ride-hailing. Younger generations have high interest in automated and electrified vehicles relative to their current adoption of these technologies, suggesting that young people could contribute substantially to future market growth-as they are doing for ride-hailing. We find no evidence that longer commutes present a barrier to plug-in electric vehicle adoption. Finally, women are less likely than men to adopt and/or be interested in adopting most new transportation technologies, with the exception of ride-hailing; designing or marketing technologies with women's preferences in mind could contribute to future market expansion.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361920918303122?via%3Dihub=
Municipal Adaptation to Changing Curbside Demands: Exploratory Findings from Semi-Structured Interviews with Ten U.S. Cities,"Researchers document a trend of organizational restructuring to more formally include curbside management teams, with the majority of interviewees also reporting increased staffing. Respondents reported that operational failures at their curbside (e.g., demand in excess of capacity) have impacts on safety, capacity, and emergency vehicle mobility, with impacts highly concentrated spatially and temporally (e.g., late evenings in nightlife districts). We document a diversity of data flows between ridehailing operators (e.g., Uber, Lyft) and municipalities, with some cities reporting obtaining types of data that other cities report not receiving despite requesting such data. Finally, respondents consistently expressed a desire for new data streams and methodologies to help manage the curbside of the future. It is hoped that establishing the state of the practice in this rapidly changing context will be of use to practitioners facing similar pressures as those of our interviewees.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967070X19308923
In-route Inductive Versus Stationary Conductive Charging for Shared Automated Electric Vehicles: A University Shuttle Service,"In-route inductive charging technology, as applied to automated electric vehicles, can help realize a fully automated system of both vehicles and chargers. This study presents a planning optimization analysis for fixed-route automated shuttles supported by in-route inductive charging technology. A techno-economic feasibility of inductive charging was assessed in comparison with stationary charging, including Level 2 AC chargers, and DC fast chargers (DCFCs). This analysis considered both present-day and future vehicle operations and overall system costs. A real project with two circulator Navya Arma shared automated electric vehicles (SAEVs) at the University of Michigan was investigated using real-world collected energy and travel data. The outcomes show that the proper design of quasi-dynamic inductive chargers at designated stops allows SAEVs to realize unlimited driving range and be cost-competitive to DCFC technology. Considering present-day costs and vehicles, low-speed SAEVs can realize charge-sustaining operation at a minimum cost either by implementing a 50-kW inductive charger at two stops with one segment per position and a 29-kWh onboard battery, or by installing a 100-kW inductive charger at one stop with one segment per position and a 28-kWh onboard battery. Considering future costs and vehicles, either a 40-kW charger at one stop with a 29-kWh battery or a 50-kW charger at the north stop with a 14-kWh battery would enable charge-sustaining operation. In addition, quasi-dynamic inductive solution can reduce the onboard battery by about 15% while providing unlimited driving range, but stationary scenarios require about 112% additional battery capacity to support a 12-h driving range.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2021,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261920315476
Heterogeneous Machine Learning on High Performance Computing for End to End Driving Autonomous Vehicles,"Current artificial intelligence techniques for end to end driving of autonomous vehicles typically rely on a single form of learning or training processes along with a corresponding dataset or simulation environment. Relatively speaking, success has been shown for a variety of learning modalities in which it can be shown that the machine can successfully ""drive"" a vehicle. However, the realm of real-world driving extends significantly beyond the realm of limited test environments for machine training. This creates an enormous gap in capability between these two realms. With their superior neural network structures and learning capabilities, humans can be easily trained within a short period of time to proceed from limited test environments to real world driving. For machines though, this gap is guarded by at least two challenges: 1) machine learning techniques remain brittle and unable to generalize to a wide range of scenarios, and 2) effective training data that enhances generalization and generates the desired driving behavior. Further, each challenge can be computationally intensive on its own thereby exasperating the gap. Moreover, it has not yet been shown that a single form or learning or training is capable of addressing a larger range of scenarios. As a result, solving the first challenge does not inherently solve the second and vice versa. The work described here discusses an approach to address the first challenge that would also provide a foundation for solving the second. Our approach utilizes a combination of conditional limitation learning with a static dataset, reinforcement learning with a simulation environment, and high-performance computing to train a neural network. As a result, this reduces the ""time to solution"" to the existing techniques for autonomous driving and provides an extensible framework to address the second key challenge.

A Minimum Principle-based Algorithm for Energy-efficient Eco-driving of Electric Vehicles in Various Traffic and Road Conditions,"This paper presents an optimization algorithm for energy-efficient driving of electric vehicles. The algorithm is based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle by considering the driving mission as an optimal control problem. On a planned route, diverse application cases may occur due to various physical traits such as powertrain (e.g., switching between motor and generator operation), environmental variations (e.g., terrain grade change), traffic laws (e.g., speed limits), and safety concerns (e.g., headway to the leading vehicle). The proposed algorithm handles these real-world challenges by considering the perturbation to the system dynamics and the constraints to the control and state variables",Argonne National Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343115400_A_Minimum_Principle-Based_Algorithm_for_Energy-Efficient_Eco-Driving_of_Electric_Vehicles_in_Various_Traffic_and_Road_Conditions
Highway Eco-Driving of an Electric Vehicle Based on Minimum Principle,"The digital map in the on-board navigation system on passenger vehicles nowadays gives controllers access to detailed information of a planned route. Connected automated vehicles equipped with high computing power, are able to process data and leverage high control freedom available through automation. This paper proposes a fast optimization algorithm for eco-driving of electric vehicles in highway cruising scenarios. The algorithm is based on optimal control theory and takes into account road grades as well as state constraints imposed by speed limits and safe headway to the preceding car. Using Autonomie, the proposed algorithm is evaluated by simulating two example scenarios. The first result demonstrates an energy saving potential of 4.4%.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327871230_Highway_Eco-Driving_of_an_Electric_Vehicle_Based_on_Minimum_Principle
Fuel-Optimal Periodic Control of Passenger Cars in Cruise Based on Pontryagin's Minimum Principle,"This paper aims to exploit the fuel saving potential of a passenger car in cruising scenarios by deriving an optimal periodic control strategy based on Pontyagin's Minimum Principle. Gear shifting and coupling between the engine and the driveline are explicitly included in the optimal control problem, and this leads to a hybrid system. By investigating the analytically derived optimal trajectory in the state space, we confirm the optimal periodic control. Considerable advantages in fuel economy up to 4.8 % compared to conventional steady control are demonstrated.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327870967_Fuel-Optimal_Periodic_Control_of_Passenger_Cars_in_Cruise_Based_on_Pontryagin's_Minimum_Principle
Individualized Gap-based Convergence in an Agent-based Dynamic Traffic Assignment Model Using an Information Mixing Approach for Time-dependent Travel Times,"This study proposes an individualized convergence approach for the agent-based dynamic traffic assignment problem. The name agent-based comes from the fact that each traveler is routed individually from their specific origin to their specific destination at a specific departure time. The approach is gap-based two-folds. Firstly, the re-assignment decision is based on the gap between the routed and experienced travel time from the previous iteration, which is an existing method in the literature. Secondly, the historical time-dependent and prevailing traffic conditions are averaged using the weight calculated by a modified two-parameter Weibull survival function. This weight is individualized based on the relative gap of the traveler from the previous iteration, as well as the iteration number. This information mixing approach is a novel contribution of this study. The methodology is tested on a medium-scale network of Bloomington, IL in the United States of America. The algorithm converges after only two iterations, which is very promising especially for large-scale networks where the computational time of a single iteration can be very high.",Argonne National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://trid.trb.org/view/1573280
Efficient Fuel and VMT Taxation for Automated Vehicles,"Road travel in light-duty vehicles, while of great economic value to private consumers and society, also generates a range of social costs. These include environmental damage from localized and global emissions, energy security concerns from petroleum use, external accident risk, and road congestion. These social costs are addressed only partially by the existing system of fuel taxation and road charges. Research on efficient pricing discusses how taxes might be set on motor fuel and road use to reflect social costs of motor vehicle use. The challenge is to understand how fuel and mileage taxation can alter market outcomes to better manage external costs while taking into account the appropriate level and balance of taxation. Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) promise marked improvements in mobility and safety. CAVs will also have impacts on energy use, emissions, travel demand and congestion that are difficult to estimate, but relevant for social costs and the effectiveness of taxation. Because CAVs can change how people assess their time in vehicles, both in terms of quantity and quality, it is important to design robust policies that can allow the market development of CAVs to take advantage of their private benefits while establishing incentives for beneficial environmental and social outcomes. The authors' research makes the first known contribution to proposing efficient tax levels for CAV road travel. It extends the existing research for conventional manually-driven vehicles and considers how tax policy may need to change for CAVs given their substantially different societal impacts and private incentives.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://trid.trb.org/view/1496760
Developing an Integrated Framework for Assessing Potential Impacts of Telecommuting,"The current study establishes an integrated framework to examine the impacts of home-based telecommuting on travel behavior, network congestion, and air quality. The authors first estimate a telecommuting adoption behavior model using a revealed choice data obtained from the CMAP Travel Tracker Survey. In doing so, an extension of zero-inflated ordered probit model is utilized to determine the factors affecting workers' propensity to adopt telecommuting. Second, the authors implement the estimated model in the POLARIS activity-based framework to simulate the potential changes in workers' activity-travel patterns and network congestion. Third, the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) mobile source emission model, MOVES, is used to estimate the potential changes in vehicular emissions in the network as a result of the policy. Different adoption scenarios are then tested and it is found that telecommuting can reduce total daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT) up to 2.4% and 4.15%, respectively. The authors also found that this policy has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) and particulate matter (PM ?.?) emissions by up to 2.65% and 2.95%, respectively. In summary, the authors' results endorse the fact that telecommuting policy has the potential to reduce network congestion and vehicular emissions, specifically during rush hours.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://trid.trb.org/view/1494744
Developing a Platform to Analyze Behavioral Impacts of Connected and Automated Vehicles at the National Level,"This study aims to develop a methodological framework that utilizes multiclass data fusion and data transferability techniques, which uses data and models from a smaller geographical area (e.g., Chicago and Detroit) to generate the needed disaggregate data in a larger scale (e.g., national level). This framework is able to perform a comprehensive examination on the impacts of CAV in transportation networks. To achieve this goal, an advanced transportation systems simulation model, POLARIS, which simulates both travel behavior and traffic flow, is used to estimate the potential impacts of CAV technologies at a regional- level. The rich output of CAV scenario analysis in POLARIS framework includes information on person- level and household-level socio-demographic attributes as well as detailed activity-travel patterns. Transferable variables such as total trip rates and travel times are also derived from POLARIS. Following that, the authors use Exhaustive CHAID decision tree models for each transferable variable to cluster people into several homogeneous groups through which various types of lifestyles are captured. The best-fitted statistical distribution for each of the final decision tree clusters is then determined to analyze the specific behavior of members of each cluster toward transferable variables. Finally, using an artificial neural network model, cluster membership rules and travel statistics are transferred to the national level to develop a validated baseline national platform for analyzing connected automated vehicles scenarios. The platform that is capable of transferring travel behavior to national level with high level of accuracy will be utilized to test various policies and scenarios that may affect the use of CAV and their national impacts.",Argonne National Laboratory,2017,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://trid.trb.org/view/1439507
Developing A Spatial Transferability Platform to Analyze National-level Impacts of Connected Automated Vehicles,"A recent application of the spatial transferability approach is to assess the potential impacts of the emerging connected automated mobility technology on people's travel behavior at the national level. While there are a few transportation simulation frameworks which can account for potential impacts of this technology in a simulated geographical context, there is yet to be any literature documenting disaggregated estimates of large-scale impacts of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) on travel behavior at the national level. Therefore, in order to provide a platform to assess national-level impacts of CAVs, this study develops a methodological framework based on transferability techniques, which uses data and models from a smaller geographical area-the POLARIS simulation results for the CAVs scenario in the Chicago metropolitan area-to generate disaggregate travel data at the national level. Comparison of the distributions of the transferred variables at the regional and the national contexts indicates that the platform is capable of transferring travel behavior indices to the national level with high level of accuracy.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-89806-3_12
Data-driven Multi-step Demand Prediction for Ride-hailing Services Using Convolutional Neureal Network ,"Ride-hailing services are growing rapidly and becoming one of the most disruptive technologies in the transportation realm. Accurate prediction of ride-hailing trip demand not only enables cities to better understand people's activity patterns, but also helps ride-hailing companies and drivers make informed decisions to reduce deadheading vehicle miles traveled, traffic congestion, and energy consumption. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning model is proposed for multi-step ride-hailing demand prediction using the trip request data in Chengdu, China, offered by DiDi Chuxing. The CNN model is capable of accurately predicting the ride-hailing pick-up demand at each 1-km by 1-km zone in the city of Chengdu for every 10 min. Compared with another deep learning model based on long short-term memory, the CNN model is 30% faster for the training and predicting process. The proposed model can also be easily extended to make multi-step predictions, which would benefit the on-demand shared autonomous vehicles applications and fleet operators in terms of supply-demand rebalancing. The prediction error attenuation analysis shows that the accuracy stays acceptable as the model predicts more steps.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-17798-0_2
Factors Influencing Willingness to Pool in Ride-Hailing Trips,"In this study, newly available Chicago transportation network provider data were explored to identify the extent to which different socioeconomic, spatiotemporal, and trip characteristics affect willingness to pool (WTP) in ride-hailing trips. Multivariate linear regression and machine-learning models were employed to understand and predict WTP based on location, time, and trip factors. The results show intuitive trends, with income level at drop-off and pickup locations and airport trips as the most important predictors of WTP. Results from this study can help TNCs and cities devise strategies that increase pooled ride-hailing, thereby reducing adverse transportation and energy impacts from ride-hailing modes.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361198120915886
Analysis of Transit Users' Response Behavior in Case of Unplanned Service Disruptions,"Utilizing recently collected data of transit users in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, the current study aims to analyze how transit users respond to an unplanned service disruption and disclose the factors that affect their behavior. In this study, a random parameter multinomial logit model is employed to consider heterogeneity across observations as well as panel effects. The results of the analysis reveal that a wide range of factors including socio-demographic attributes, personal attitudes, trip-related information, and built environment are significant in passengers' behavior in case of unplanned transit disruptions. Moreover, the effect of service recovery time on passengers is not the same among all types of disrupted services; rail users are more sensitive to the recovery time as compared with bus users. The findings of this study provide insights for transportation authorities to improve the transit service quality in relation to user satisfaction and transportation resilience. These insights help transit agencies to implement effective recovery strategies.",Argonne National Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0361198120911921
Analysis of the Effects of Connected-Automated Vehicle Technologies on Travel Demand,"Connected-automated vehicle (CAV) technologies are likely to have significant effects not only on how vehicles operate in the transportation system, but also on how individuals behave and use their vehicles. While many CAV technologies-such as connected adaptive cruise control and ecosignals-have the potential to increase network throughput and efficiency, many of these same technologies have a secondary effect of reducing driver burden, which can drive changes in travel behavior. Such changes in travel behavior-in effect, lowering the cost of driving-have the potential to increase greatly the utilization of the transportation system with concurrent negative externalities, such as congestion, energy use, and emissions, working against the positive effects on the transportation system resulting from increased capacity. To date, few studies have analyzed the potential effects on CAV technologies from a systems perspective; studies often focus on gains and losses to an individual vehicle, at a single intersection, or along a corridor. However, travel demand and traffic flow constitute a complex, adaptive, nonlinear system. Therefore, in this study, an advanced transportation systems simulation model-POLARIS-was used. POLARIS includes cosimulation of travel behavior and traffic flow to study the potential effects of several CAV technologies at the regional level. Various technology penetration levels and changes in travel time sensitivity have been analyzed to determine a potential range of effects on vehicle miles traveled from various CAV technologies.",Argonne National Laboratory,2017,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3141/2625-01

Potential Energy Implications of Connected and Automated Vehicles: Exploring Key Leverage Points through Scenario Screening and Analysis,"The authors have developed a system dynamics model for generating, analyzing, and screening self-consistent CAV adoption scenarios. Results can support selection of scenarios for subsequent computationally intensive study using higher-resolution models. The potential for and barriers to large-scale adoption of CAVs have been analyzed using preliminary quantitative data and qualitative understandings of system relationships among stakeholders across the breadth of these issues. Although they are based on preliminary data, the results map possibilities for achieving different levels of CAV adoption and system-wide fuel use and demonstrate the interplay of behavioral parameters such as how consumers value their time versus financial parameters such as operating cost. By identifying the range of possibilities, estimating the associated energy and transportation service outcomes, and facilitating screening of scenarios for more detailed analysis, this work could inform transportation planners, researchers, and regulators.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198119838840
"Clustering Life Course to Understand the Heterogeneous Effects of Life Events, Gender, and Generation on Habitual Travel Modes","Daily transportation mode choice is largely habitual, but transitions between life events may disrupt travel habits and can shift choices between alternative transportation modes. Although much is known about general mode switches following life event transitions, less is understood about differences that may exist between subpopulations, especially from a long-term perspective. Understanding these differences will help planners and policymakers introduce more targeted policy interventions to promote sustainable transportation modes and inform longer-term predictions. Extending beyond existing literature, we use data collected from a retrospective survey to investigate the effects of life course events on mode use situated within different long-term life trajectory contexts. We apply a machine-learning method called joint social sequence clustering to define five distinct and interpretable cohorts based on trajectory patterns in family and career domains over their life courses. We use these patterns as an innovative contextual system to investigate (1) the heterogeneous effects of life events on travel mode use and (2) further differentiation between gender and generation groups in these life event effects. We find that events occurring relatively early in life are more strongly associated with changes in mode-use behavior, and that mode use can also be affected by the relative order of events. This timing and order effect can have lasting impacts on mode use aggregated over entire life cycles: members of our ""Have-it-alls"" cohort-who finish their education, start working, partner up, and have children early in life-ramp up car use at each event, resulting in the highest rate of car use occurring the earliest among all the cohorts. Women drive more when having children primarily when their family formation and career formation are intertwined early in life, and younger generations rely relatively more on car use during familial events when their careers have a later start.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9229427
Exploring the Mobility and Energy Implications of Shared Versus Private Autonomous Vehicles,"The prevailing trend toward greater automation and connectivity requires modeling and analysis tools to explore connectivity, automation, decision science and other future mobility issues at multiple scales.

"Optimum Planning for Inductively Charged On-demand Automated Electric Shuttles at Greenville, South Carolina","Wireless charging technology presents perfect fits for autonomous electric vehicles for realizing a fully automated system (vehicle and charger). This paper presents a planning optimization analysis for a pilot project of in-route wireless charging infrastructure serving fixed-route on-demand shared automated electric shuttles (SAESs) at Greenville, South Carolina, USA. A single-objective non-linear integer planning optimization problem is formulated. A comprehensive cost function representing the inductively charged SAESs is developed, considering road construction, power electronics and materials, traction battery, and installation costs. The optimization problem is solved to determine the best combination of the system key design parameters (number and allocations of wireless chargers, charging power level, track length and on-board battery capacity) that show the most cost-effective solution and allow the SAESs realizing charge sustaining operation. The planning platform incorporates representative simulated traffic data (drive cycles and routes) for four SAESs at Greenville project using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) tool. These data are fed to a vehicle powertrain model and a wireless charger power model to predict the battery power, energy and state-of-charge (SOC) profiles, which are provided to the search algorithm to assess the design objectives under specific constraints. The results indicated that implementing wireless charging at a few designated stops for fixed-route SAESs with proper design allows the vehicles realizing charge sustaining operation, infinite range and zero recharge downtime, with a significant reduction in the on-board battery (36 % ) and road coverage (69%), at minimum cost.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8912343
Joint Fleet Sizing and Charging System Planning for Autonomous Electric Vehicles,"This paper studies the joint fleet sizing and charging system planning problem for a company operating a fleet of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs) for passenger and goods transportation. Most of the relevant published papers focus on intracity scenarios and adopt heuristic approaches, e.g., agent based simulation, which do not guarantee optimality. In contrast, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model for intercity scenarios. This model incorporates comprehensive considerations of 1) limited AEV driving range; 2) optimal AEV routing and relocating operations; 3) time-varying origin-destination transport demands; and 4) differentiated operation cost structure of passenger and goods transportation. The proposed model can be computational expensive when the scale of the transportation network is large. We then exploit the structure of this program to expedite its solution. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the proposed method. Our experimental results show that AEVs in passenger and goods transportation have remarkable planning and operation differences. We also demonstrate that intelligent routing and relocating operations, charging system and vehicle parameters, e.g., charging power, battery capacity, driving speed etc., can significantly affect the economic efficiency and the planning results of an AEV fleet.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8880643
An Automated Vehicle Fuel Economy Benefits Evaluation Framework Using Real-World Travel and Traffic Data,"Increasing automation is a consistent development trend in the automobile industry. However, real-world evaluation of the operational and energy consumption differences between automated vehicles and comparable manually driven vehicles has been limited. This study helps fill the information gap by comparing the operation and fuel economy of vehicles in adaptive cruise control (ACC) and non-ACC modes based on large-scale field test data collected by Volvo Car Corporation (Volvo Cars) from vehicles traveling on the designated ""Drive Me"" project road network in Gothenburg, Sweden. The test vehicles' travel data are classified by driving mode (ACC vs. non-ACC) and driving conditions, which refer to traffic speed and road grade in this study. The results from the data logging fleet are used to estimate the aggregate fuel consumption differences at the Drive Me road-network level for vehicles traveling in ACC vs. non-ACC mode based on appropriately weighting the total amount of travel that took place on the network under different driving conditions. At the ACC penetration levels observed in the field test data, vehicles tended to drive more smoothly in ACC mode than in non-ACC mode. The corresponding travel-weighted fuel consumption rate for vehicles in ACC mode was about 5%-7% lower than for vehicles in non-ACC mode when traveling at similar conditions. Sensitivity analyses impart confidence in this result, and in the future, the established evaluation framework could be used to objectively quantify potential on-road fuel consumption impacts from vehicles with even higher levels of automated driving capability.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8744229
Minimizing Energy Consumption from Connected Signalized Intersections by Reinforcement Learning,"Explicit energy minimization objectives are often discouraged in signal optimization algorithms due to its negative impact on mobility performance. One potential direction to solve this problem is to provide a balanced objective function to achieve desired mobility with minimized energy consumption. This research developed a reinforcement learning (RL) based control with reward functions considering energy and mobility in a joint manner-a penalty function is introduced for number of stops. Further, we proposed a clustering-based technique to make the state-space finite which is critical for a tractable implementation of the RL algorithm. We implemented the algorithm in a calibrated NG-SIM network within a traffic micro-simulator-PTV VISSIM. With sole focus on energy, we report 47% reduction in energy consumption when compared with existing signal control schemes, however causing a 65.6% increase in system travel time. In contrast, the control strategy focusing on energy minimization with penalty for stops yields 6.7% reduction in energy consumption with 27% increase in system travel time. The developed RL algorithm with a flexible penalty function in the reward will achieve desired energy goals for a network of signalized intersections without compromising on the mobility performance.

Simulation of Heavy-Duty Vehicles in Platooning Scenarios,"Connectivity and automation provide the potential to use information about the environment and future driving to minimize energy consumption. In order to achieve this goal, the designers of control strategies need to simulate a wide range of driving situations that can interact with other vehicles and the infrastructure to account for the specific powertrain characteristics of each automated vehicle. We present here a simulation framework called RoadRunner, which aims to facilitate the design of powertrain-aware eco-driving algorithms and a better understanding of the interactions between automation and powertrain technology. RoadRunner allows users to simulate both powertrain and longitudinal dynamics within a simulated environment. The user defines the scenario to be simulated by providing a route profile, intersection control types, number of vehicles, vehicle class, powertrain technology, connectivity, and automation level. RoadRunner then builds a Simulink diagram of the scenario, including the information flows between vehicles, and between vehicles and the road. After the simulation, the user can analyze the driving, component operations, and detailed energy consumption rates for each simulated vehicle. We present a case study on heavy-duty vehicles platooning. Using RoadRunner and detailed road data from digital maps, we quantify the impact of gap setting on fuel consumption, for a real-world route.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8569275

Citywide Impacts of E-Commerce: Does Parcel Delivery Travel Outweigh Household Shopping Reductions?,"E-commerce has facilitated online ordering of goods by households in recent years. The technological advancement has disrupted shopping related transportation. While the National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS) finds that household shopping frequency has declined in the last 10-20 years, deliveries by parcel delivery trucks and vans have increase. However, the net effect of these phenomena on overall trip making, vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) and fuel consumption has not been quantified. From a regional planning perspective, understanding the net effect is important for informing city policies- for example, in regards to land use and transportation planning. The objective of this research is to address this gap. In this study, the net regional impact of e-commerce on transportation and fuel consumption is evaluated.

Evaluating the Effects of Missing Values and Mixed Data Types on Social Sequence Clustering Using t-SNE Visualization,"The goal of this work is to investigate the impact of missing values in clustering joint categorical social sequences. Identifying patterns in sociodemographic longitudinal data is important in a number of social science settings. However, performing analytical operations, such as clustering on life course trajectories, is challenging due to the categorical and multidimensional nature of the data, their mixed data types, and corruption by missing and inconsistent values. Data quality issues were investigated previously on single variable sequences. To understand their effects on multivariate sequence analysis, we employ a dataset of mixed data types and missing values, a dissimilarity measure designed for joint categorical sequence data, together with dimensionality reduction methodologies in a systematic design of sequence clustering experiments. Given the categorical nature of our data, we employ an ""edit"" distance using optimal matching. Because each data record has multiple variables of different types, we investigate the impact of mixing these variables in a single dissimilarity measure. Between variables with binary values and those with multiple nominal values, we find that the ability to overcome missing data problems is more difficult in the nominal domain than in the binary domain. Additionally, alignment of leading missing values can result in systematic biases in dissimilarity matrices and subsequently introduce both artificial clusters and unrealistic interpretations of associated data domains. We demonstrate the usage of t-distributed stochastic neighborhood embedding to visually guide mitigation of such biases by tuning the missing value substitution cost parameter or determining an optimal sequence span.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3301294

However, these solutions were derived assuming that the desired distance headway policy does not include a speed change over a predictive horizon, and that the preceding vehicle has constant acceleration. We use the desired time headway policy that includes the speed change to define the first-order pure state constraint. We then derive analytical solutions using the direct adjoining method based on Pontryagin's minimum principle. We also present a novel solver to compute energy-optimal and collision-free state trajectories by accounting for a piecewise constant acceleration of the preceding vehicle without using any numerical optimization methods that require initial guesses. For simple scenarios with one intersection, we analyze how the novel solver allows CAVs to smoothly pass through the signalized intersection and then reach a desired cruising speed. We also use a simulation framework based on high-fidelity powertrain models to validate its effectiveness based on energy savings when driving on real-world urban routes.",Argonne National Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/DSCC/proceedings-abstract/DSCC2020/V001T10A001/1096436
"A Convergence of Public-Private Benefits in Denver: Surveys and Analyses to Inform Urban Mobility, Energy, Infrastructure, and Behavior-Related Data ","Cities, public transit agencies, and new private ride hailing services seek to understand emerging traveler dynamics, the shifting demographics of urban travelers,and new energy-efficient mobility opportunities. This includes exploring how new infrastructure investments, public and private mobility services, and smart-phone mobility apps are reshaping behaviors, demands (e.g. mobility-on-demand services), travel experiences and energy-efficient urban travel preferences. Currently, cities and metropolitan regions are providing and experimenting with many new mobility options, technologies, and personalized information services at the intersection of urban mobility, energy, and infrastructure systems (e.g., new commuter rail). To date, technology alone has not been able to crack the nut of ""creating faster trip times, less congestion, safer streets, and cleaner air for its citizens through fewer cars on the road"". This paper focuses on this gap by offering new concepts and potential for integrated approaches. Accommodating more vehicles miles traveled in cities, without increases in person miles traveled (PMT), could be costly, generating: 1) tremendous demands for new infrastructure, land, road space, materials, and energy; 2) higher traffic fatality risks; and 3) worsening air quality. Therefore, this study focuses on reducing single occupancy vehicle use by enhancing integrated mobility, helping transit and ridehailing increase occupancy in ways that also reduce energy use, and improve quality of life for urban travelers and communities. This study focuses on a survey of urban travelers in Denver, as a representative case study for metropolitan regions experiencing rapid growth, ageing populations, increased urban sprawl, traffic-related delays, and inefficient energy use per PMT.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2017,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,http://www.energy.gov/node/4793457
"Exploring Energy-Efficiency and Sustainable Urban Mobility Strategies: An Initial Framework to Curate Data/Models, Measure Performance, and Diffuse Innovation","Many cities across the United States seek to understand the maturity of data and models that are available to help manage challenges, opportunities, and uncertainties associated with the shifts in technologies, human behaviors and sustainable urban mobility strategies. One key question identified for smart city action planning includes how to best shape continuous improvements for urban populations at the intersection of mobility, energy, and quality of life? With the emerging megatrends of urbanization (more than 70% of world population in cities by 2050), on-demand shared mobility, vehicle electrification, and automated vehicles, initial ""urban science"" studies to date have demonstrated the potential and need for maturing the related data and model ecosystems and on-going performance measurement across multiple urban system goals: e.g., from more mobility, clean and efficient energy use, accessibility and safety to less air pollution, traffic, and resource-intensive urban sprawl. To build on emerging literature and understand city responses to disruptive change, this initial study engages researchers and practitioners across four smart city finalists (Columbus, Denver, Austin and Portland) that competed in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Smart City Challenge. The initial results emphasize the need for a suite of datasets and diverse analytical approaches that support U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)-relevant research with cities. Considering desirable energy and mobility outcomes as a first step to advancing smart city solutions strategies, we systematically review approaches of and shortcomings in four U.S. cities, and suggest improvements in three areas: me",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2017,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,http://www.energy.gov/node/4793455

Novel and Practical Method to Quantify the Quality of Mobility: Mobility Energy Productivity Metric,"Recent technology innovations are enabling fundamental improvements in mobility systems, including options for new travel modes, methods, and opportunities to connect people with goods, services, and employment. A desire to quantify and compare both existing and emerging transportation options motivated development of the mobility energy productivity (MEP) metric described here. The MEP metric fundamentally measures the potential of a city's transportation system to connect a person to a variety of services and activities that define a high quality of life, relative to the convenience, cost, and energy needed to provide these connections. Fundamentally derived from accessibility theory, the MEP advances practice by using readily available travel time data (either from web-based application programming interfaces or outputs from an urban transportation model) combined with established parameters that reflect the energy intensity and cost of various travel modes, and relative frequency of activity engagement. The construction of the MEP metric allows for aggregation and disaggregation to the appropriate spatial, modal, and trip purpose resolution, as analysis needs dictate. As a result, the MEP could be used to compare alternative futures related to technology, infrastructure investment, or policy, providing a much-needed tool for planners, researchers, and analysts.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772520
Will Advanced Public Charging Infrastructure Speed up Electrification of Future Transportation?,"This study focuses on evaluating impacts of advanced, urban public charging infrastructure on the battery electric vehicle (BEV) adoption in the U.S market. Under various infrastructure scenarios (e.g., current and developed conditions), we investigate the infrastructure impacts on the near-term BEV adoption using a consumer-choice based market simulation approach. Our results suggest that current public charging infrastructure has continuous and significant impacts on the near-term BEV adoption. Additional infrastructure investment could further stimulate the public acceptance of BEVs. We also find that the actual infrastructure impact may vary depending on the assumption of how charging deployment could affect consumers' access of chargers and consumers' daily available charging time. However, this impact variability could be reduced when infrastructure is getting mature.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772519
Impact of Model Simplification on Optimal Control of Combustion Engine and Electric Vehicles Considering Control Input Constraints ,"This paper analyzes the impact of model simplification on optimal control for electric and conventional engine-powered vehicles. An optimal control problem is formulated to minimize energy/fuel consumption subject to control input constraints and solved analytically using the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle. We found that simplified solutions without nonlinear aerodynamic drag are sub-optimal, and their loss of optimality increases with average travel speed. The energy/fuel savings of each control approach are evaluated using the intelligent driver model to capture driving behavior of a driver.

On the Traffic Impacts of Optimally Controlled Connected and Automated Vehicles,"The implementation of connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technologies enables a novel computational framework for real-time control actions aimed at optimizing energy consumption and associated benefits. Several research efforts reported in the literature to date have proposed decentralized control algorithms to coordinate CAVs in various traffic scenarios, e.g., highway on-ramps, intersections, and roundabouts. However, the impact of optimally coordinating CAVs on the performance of a transportation network has not been thoroughly analyzed yet. In this paper, we apply a decentralized optimal control framework in a transportation network and compare its performance to a baseline scenario consisting of human-driven vehicles. We show that introducing of CAVs yields radically improved roadway capacity and network performance.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2019,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772517
A Comprehensive Approach to Measure the Efficiency of Freight Transport: Freight Mobility Energy Productivity (F-MEP) Metric,"Freight travel accounts for a major share of the energy consumed in the transportation sector in any country, and the United States is no exception. Understanding and modeling freight movement is critical, particularly in the context of capturing the impact of emerging technologies on freight travel and its externalities. The domain of freight modeling and forecasting is gaining pace in the recent years, but advancement in comprehensive freight performance metrics is still lagging. Conventional freight performance metrics such as truck-miles, ton-miles, or value-miles are unidimensional and aggregated in nature, making them unsuitable to accurately capture the impact of emerging transportation trends on the performance of freight systems. Addressing this research need, this paper presents the 'Freight Mobility Energy Productivity' metric to quantify freight performance of current as well as future freight systems, accounting for various costs associated with freight transport. The proposed metric was implemented using data from the Freight Analysis Framework along with other published sources, which shows intuitive results in quantifying freight performance. Further, a scenario analysis exercise was conducted to test the capability of the metric in tracking improvements in system-level freight efficiency as a result of vehicle powertrain technology improvement. Results of the scenario analysis reinforcemore >> confidence that the proposed metric can be used as a decision support tool in assessing the efficiency of existing as well as future freight trends and technologies.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2020,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Conference Paper,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772516

In this framework, we use optimal control to simulate the behavior of CAVs and the Gipps car following model to capture the behavior of human-driven vehicles. The simulation results show that CAVs can contribute to significant fuel consumption and travel time reduction for diverse traffic conditions under average and high congestion scenarios.

Cooperative and Integrated Vehicle and Intersection Control for Energy Efficiency ,"We propose a two-level approach that jointly optimizes the traffic signal timing and vehicles' approach speed, with the objective being to minimize total energy consumption for all vehicles passing through an isolated intersection. More specifically, at the intersection level, a dynamic programming algorithm is designed to find the optimal signal timing by explicitly considering the arrival time and energy profile of each vehicle. At the vehicle level, a model predictive control strategy is adopted to ensure that vehicles pass through the intersection in a timely fashion. Our simulation study has shown that the proposed CIVIC-E 2 system can significantly improve intersection performance under various traffic conditions. Furthermore, compared with conventional fixed-time and actuated signal control strategies, the proposed algorithm can reduce energy consumption and queue length by up to 31% and 95%, respectively.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772512

We show that fuel consumption is adversely affected for medium and high traffic while benefits are realized for travel time under the same traffic conditions. As a result, we also show that higher penetrations of CAVs contribute to more stable traffic patterns.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publicaton,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772510
Optimizing Fleet Operations in Automated Mobility Districts: Serving On-demand Mobility with Automated Electric Shuttles,"On-demand transportation services have seen a dramatic rise in the past decade, thanks to technology. Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology holds potential for a major transformation in the on-demand mobility services landscape.The timeline for fully automated vehicles (AVs) to reach the critical market share is still uncertain. In the short term, many cities in the United States and abroad are testing low-speed automated electric shuttles (AES) as a shared on-demand mobility service in geo-fenced regions. An automated mobility district (AMD) is a campus-sized implementation of connected/automated vehicle technology to realize the full benefits of a fully electric automated mobility service within a confined region or district. Building on this concept, an AMD toolkit is under development at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to inform a campus-or district-sized implementation in which automated electric shuttles (AES).

Energy Impact Evaluation for Eco-Routing and Charging of Autonomous Electric Vehicle Fleet: Ambient Temperature Consideration,"This paper studies the heterogeneous energy cost and charging demand impact of autonomous electric vehicle(EV) fleet under different ambient temperature. A data-driven method is introduced to formulate a two-dimensional grid stochastic energy consumption model for electric vehicles. This model aids in analyzing EV energy cost and describing uncertainties under variable traffic and ambient temperature conditions. According to this energy consumption model, an optimal eco-routing and charging decision making framework is designed for autonomous EV fleet. This optimization framework can improve the capability of autonomous EV's energy management and help to find their minimum energy cost routes with consideration of charging demand and travel time requirements. Based on these promising models and technologies, comprehensive case studies are performed on a data-driven simulated transportation network in New York City. Detailed results show us the heterogeneous energy impact and charging demand under different ambient temperature. By giving the same travel demand and charging station information, there may be more than 20% difference of overall energy cost and 60% difference of charging demand in a specific charging station between low and high ambient temperature of a month. All these studies will help to construct sustainable infrastructure for autonomous electric vehicle fleet management.",Idaho National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772507
Activity Start Time and Duration- Incorporating Regret Theory Into Joint Discrete-Continuous Models,"Activity start time and duration decisions are two key elements of activity-travel behaviour. As an effort toward a more realistic representation of individuals' decision behaviour, this paper presents a new copula-based joint model of activity start time and duration. We incorporate the regret theory into the joint modelling framework, which assumes that individuals tend to avoid the situation where non-chosen alternatives outperform the chosen one in one or more attributes. The proposed joint model comprises a hybrid utility-regret model as the discrete component to estimate activity start time and a hazard duration model as the continuous component to estimate activity duration. Since the activity type has a non-trivial impact on its start time and duration, we limit our focus to discretionary activities in this study. The comparative analysis of estimation results reveals that the proposed structure is statistically superior to the utility-based joint model and independent models. We also found that applying the regret-based decision rule for variables of travel time and travel time variability significantly improves the model. Furthermore, the significance of the estimated copula parameters confirms the existence of unobserved shared factors between the two considered activity attributes, which entails the use of joint modelling scheme.",Argonne National Laboratory,2018,Energy Efficient Mobility Systems,Journal Publication,http://www.energy.gov/node/4772503

Electrification Beyond Light Duty: Class 2b-3 Commercial Vehicles,"The class 2b-3 truck market covers a wide range of commercial truck applications across a half-million vehicle sales annually. This report collected public information and stakeholder input to assess the opportunity for electrification in this market. Although class 2b-3 pickup truck and van bodies are very similar to personal light vehicles, their functional requirements are quite different due to the demands of the commercial market. These demands vary by application and often vary from day to day for a single application. Fleet customers purchase these vehicles to perform a particular job for their business and are concerned about the overall cost of doing that job. Therefore, the vehicles must meet the job requirements cost effectively. Customers also are sensitive to initial cost. Electrification offers the potential to reduce vehicle operating costs and possibly improve vehicle functionality. However, the current market for class 2b-3 electrified trucks is very small, and the trucks are costly. Increased production volumes are key to cost reductions and may be assisted by sharing components with larger or smaller truck classes. Expanding demand is also crucial and stakeholders identified several niche markets with duty cycles that are likely well-suited to electrified class 2b-3 trucks. To expand beyond these niches, class 2b-3 electric solutions must be robust, flexible, and adaptable in order to cover a wide range of vocations, applications, and duty cycles.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2018,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434604

"Charging Electric Vehicles in Smart Cities: An EVI-Pro Analysis of Columbus, Ohio","With the support of the U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) worked with the City of Columbus, Ohio, to develop a plan for the expansion of the region's network of charging stations to support increased adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) in the local market. NREL's Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Projection (EVI-Pro) model was used to generate scenarios of regional charging infrastructure to support consumer PEV adoption. Results indicate that approximately 400 Level 2 plugs at multi-unit dwellings and 350 Level 2 plugs at non-residential locations are required to support Columbus' primary PEV goal of 5,300 PEVs on the road by the end of 2019. This analysis finds that while consumer demand for fast charging is expected to remain low (due to modest anticipated adoption of short-range battery electric vehicles), a minimum level of fast charging coverage across the city is required to ease consumer range anxiety concerns by providing a safety net for unexpected charging events. Sensitivity analyses around some key assumptions have also been performed; of these, consumer preference for PHEV versus BEV and for their electric driving range, ambient conditions, and availability of residential charging at multi-unit dwellings were identified as key determinants of the non-residential PEV charging infrastructure required to support PEV adoption. The results discussed in this report can be leveraged by similar U.S. cities as part of a strategy to accelerate PEV adoption in the light-duty vehicle market.",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,2018,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434595
Comparison of Vehicle Choice Models,"Five consumer vehicle choice models that give projections of future sales shares of light-duty vehicles were compared by running each model using the same inputs, where possible, for two scenarios. The five models compared ""LVCFlex, MA3T, LAVE-Trans, ParaChoice, and ADOPT"" have been used in support of the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Vehicle Technologies Office in analyses of future light-duty vehicle markets under different assumptions about future vehicle technologies and market conditions. The models give projections of sales shares by powertrain technology. Projections made using common, but not identical, inputs showed qualitative agreement, with the exception of ADOPT. ADOPT estimated somewhat lower advanced vehicle shares, mostly composed of hybrid electric vehicles. Other models projected large shares of multiple advanced vehicle powertrains. Projections of models differed in significant ways, including how different technologies penetrated cars and light trucks. Since the models are constructed differently and take different inputs, not all inputs were identical, but were the same or very similar where possible. Projections by all models were in close agreement only in the first few years. Although the projections from LVCFlex, MA3T, LAVE-Trans, and ParaChoice were in qualitative agreement, there were significant differences in sales shares given by the different models for individual powertrain types, particularly in later years (2030 and later). For example, projected sales shares of conventional spark-ignition vehicles in 2030 for a given scenario ranged from 35% to 74%. Reasons for such differences are discussed, recognizing that these models were not developed to give quantitatively accurate predictions of future sales shares, but to represent vehicles markets realistically and capture the connections between sales and important influences. Model features were also compared at a high level, and suggestions for further comparison of models are given to enable better understanding of how different features and algorithms used in these models may give different projections.","Argonne National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratory, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory",2017,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434592

Consumer Behavior and the Plug-In Electric Vehicle Purchase Decision Process: A Research Synthesis,"This report synthesizes consumer behavior research as it pertains to the plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) purchase decision process. The purpose is to clarify what is known about the vital role consumers play in the U.S. PEV market as it matures to become less policy-reliant and more representative of the U.S., both spatially and demographically. A more representative PEV market will: help OEMs recoup more of their R&D investments in PEVs; help American consumers access the economic and performance benefits of PEVs; and help the U.S. become more energy independent while improving air quality-related public health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2018,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434586
Transportation Electrification Beyond Light Duty: Technology and Market Assessment,"Commercial fleets form the backbone of the nation's economy, getting people and the things they need to the places they need to go and performing services necessary to keep public and private physical infrastructure in working order. Commercial fleets include a wide range of vehicle and equipment types, typical uses, and sizes, and involve millions of on-road and offroad vehicles. This diversity means there is no single solution to the challenges these vehicles pose for reducing petroleum dependence, impact on air quality, and emission of greenhouse gases. This document focuses on electrification of government, commercial, and industrial fleets. These fleets have been divided into three market segments based on equipment use: service fleets, goods movement, and people movement. In particular, it addresses highway vehicles not used for personal transport; non-highway modes, including air, rail, and water; and non-road equipment used directly or in support of these uses.",Oak Ridge National Laboratory,2017,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434583

Modeling plug-in electric vehicle charging demand with BEAM:  the framework for behavior energy autonomy mobility  ,"This report summarizes the BEAM modeling framework (Behavior, Energy, Mobility, and Autonomy) and its application to simulating plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) mobility, energy consumption, and spatiotemporal charging demand. BEAM is an agent-based model of PEV mobility and charging behavior designed as an extension to MATSim (the Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation model). We apply BEAM to the San Francisco Bay Area and conduct a preliminary calibration and validation of its prediction of charging load based on observed charging infrastructure utilization for the region in 2016. We then explore the impact of a variety of common modeling assumptions in the literature regarding charging infrastructure availability and driver behavior. We find that accurately reproducing observed charging patterns requires an explicit representation of spatially disaggregated charging infrastructure as well as a more nuanced model of the decision to charge that balances tradeoffs people make with regards to time, cost, convenience, and range anxiety.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2017,Analysis,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3434571
Implementing Workplace Charging within Federal Agencies,"The number of Americans that chose to purchase plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), which include plug-in hybrid electric vehicles(PHEVs) and all-electric vehicles (EVs), has steadily increased since 2011.

An Analysis of the Relationship between Casualty Risk Per Crash and Vehicle Mass and Footprint for Model Year 2003-2010 Light-Duty Vehicles ,"The Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office funds research on development of technologies to improve the fuel economy of both light- and heavy-duty vehicles, including advanced combustion systems, improved batteries and electric drive systems, and new lightweight materials. Of these approaches to increase fuel economy and reduce fuel consumption, reducing vehicle mass through more extensive use of strong lightweight materials is perhaps the easiest and least expensive method; however, there is a concern that reducing vehicle mass may lead to more fatalities. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) has conducted several analyses to better understand the relationship between vehicle mass, size and safety, in order to ameliorate concerns that down-weighting vehicles will inherently lead to more fatalities. These analyses include recreating the regression analyses conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that estimate the relationship between mass reduction and U.S. societal fatality risk per vehicle mile of travel (VMT), while holding vehicle size (i.e. footprint, wheelbase times track width) constant; these analyses are referred to as LBNL Phase 1 analysis.",Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,2018,Materials,Report,http://www.energy.gov/node/3369557

A Workshop to Identify Research Needs and Impacts in Predictive Simulation for Internal Combustion Engines (PreSICE),"The Workshop to Identify Research Needs and Impacts in Predictive Simulation for Internal Combustion Engines (PreSICE) focused on two near-term priorities: 1) the simulation, understanding, and control of the inherently random turbulent mixing and chemistry of combustion, 2) modern engines require the control of fuel sprays in an evolving fuel environment that is far more subtle than that needed for earlier engines and that can be obtained only through predictive modeling and simulation. The PreSICE workshop brought together 63 participants from government (16%), industry (25%), academia (35%), and the national laboratories (24%) on March 3, 2011, in Arlington, Virginia to develop a community consensus on the research needs and potential impacts of a focused DOE-led effort to create the next-generation predictive simulation-based design tools for engines.  

this report summarizes the consensus of research needs from breakout groups on the two priority areas and defines the benefits of implementing a PreSICE research and development program.
