Solar Balance of System Cost Reduction,eIQ Energy,SC0011823,Technology to Market,node/928446,Funding Opportunity,Small Business Innovation Research,SBIR,Inactive,7/28/2016, 7/27/2017,"$1,499,620 ",,San Jose,CA,95119,node/790986,37.22976,-121.78637,Gene Krzywinski,"Solar PV pricing has two primary components: hardware costs and soft costs. Hardware innovations, volume manufacturing and competition made significant effects on hardware pricing, but now hardware costs are plateau&rsquo;d and a fundamental change is needed to continue that downward pricing trend. While efforts continue to reduce soft and balance of system (BOS) costs, they too will plateau, especially with diverse components that require custom installations for virtually every site. eIQ believes that the industry must drive to standardized, integrated systems that offer plug&rsquo;n&rsquo;play benefits. eIQ Energy&rsquo;s parallel, HVDC (High Voltage DC) electronics offers to change that by taking the output of each module, regardless of its characteristics, and normalizing it to a high voltage DC buss that can be standardized regardless of the size, location, technology or end use. Each PV-module now becomes a known, independent power building block and by removing the co-dependence of modules and integrating the module and the electronics, standard building blocks can now be realized, leading to further integration and thereby reducing fixed and labor costs. Additionally, because the vBoost now adds current instead of voltage, 2x-3x more power can be transmitted over the same wire as a maximum series string configuration, leading to further cost reduction and installation simplification. The eIQ Energy patented technology works by taking the output of the PV-module, typically 20V to 120V, and boosts the voltage to between 320Vdc and 900Vdc. This voltage is determined by the part number and the HVDC buss requirements and is typically set by the inverter or the buss attached electronics such as battery storage. On the module side, the vBoost performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to ensure maximum energy extraction from the PV-module. In-circuit elements control the operation of the vBoost, including safety/remote disable, arc fault protection, and, data gathering and transmission. In Phase I, eIQ successfully developed new architecture that took the existing vBoost, encased in a large, aluminum box, and reduced it so that it can now fit within the junction box of the PV-module. Prototypes were made and tested and operate as designed. Cost targets demonstrated that the vBoost electronics are now 1/5th or so of their original cost. During Phase I, eIQ worked closely with key module manufacturers, customers and businesses to develop keen interest in the PV-module integrated vBoost and has received several letters of interest. During this time, eIQ also worked with an innovative module technology company that has developed a light weight, frameless PV-module ideal for eIQ&rsquo;s technology. The vBoost technology is also perfect for integrating renewable energy into microgrids that operate on the emerging 380Vdc buss standard. The technology is also suitable in rural electrification, agriculture and military applications. In Phase II, eIQ will productize the vBoost. This will include optimizing the prototype design, developing the enclosure and interconnections, and working with key partners on commercialization. Once completed, the technology will be able to offer a truly plug and play solution that will standardize PV installations and reduce the BOS and other soft costs.

An observer looking at a Microfluidic Light Steering (MLS) collector would initially see nothing more than a solid transparent slab. However, once an external signal is applied, the transparent block of material will jump to life and internal mirrors dynamically form to redirect sunlight. This steering of light is substantially independent of wavelength, polarization, system size, and power level. The capability is ultimately based on micron-scale capillaries containing a refractive Index Matching Fluid (IMF) distributed within a transparent solid. The physical distribution of the fluid within the capillaries allows light to be steered to a solar receiver, where it can be captured and turned into energy."

Combining a superlattice with the photonic structure increases light absorption in a very thin silicon film. The amorphous silicon portion of the structure enhances light absorption; the nanocrystalline part helps to transport light-generated electrons. Using these breakthroughs, large-area thin sheets of repeating nano- and microsized structures can be designed to absorb, convert, re-emit, and guide light.

Solutions still tend to be very customized and follow very traditional approaches to controlling resources that are very sub- optimal. Further, there is little or no coordination at all with the electric utility as this is very much an emerging area. Approaches used in other fields such as the process industries and aerospace provide powerful techniques for multivariable control problems such as the coordination and optimal control and dispatch of multiple distributed energy resources.

MLM is also critical for maintaining the highest system performance over time. MLM requires a means of communication between each solar module and a remote computer or user interface device. Two such means are currently used: radio and Power-Line Communication (PLC). The awardees introduce a third means of communication: low frequency magnetic fields. This is wireless, but not radio. Magnetic fields penetrate non-ferrous conductors like PV cells, rather than being reflected. Also, magnetic fields don't propagate like radio waves do, so magnetic communication (mag com) has very short range, in this case typically less than three feet. Mag com costs less than radio or PLC. Furthermore, mag com may be able to detect and locate series arc faults at a significantly lower cost. Present methods of detecting series arc faults only determine which string contains the fault, but the new method can determine the specific solar module where the arc fault is occurring. This lowers O&M costs by avoiding a time-consuming search for the fault, and getting the system back on line sooner."
