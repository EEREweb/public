This low-cost, scalable technology can open up the residential rooftop market in the US to the 25 million households that are part of homeowner associations (HOAs). HOAs often have restrictive covenants that prevent, or make it time consuming and expensive, for homeowners to install solar due to perceived insufficient aesthetics. This technology removes this barrier by making the solar blend in with rooftops while still producing energy comparable with mainstream blue/black crystalline solar panels. Further, the technology opens up the possibility of using solar as a branding/advertising asset, generating alternative revenue streams that absent of government subsidies can achieve payback in under 3 years. This can stimulate the commercial solar carport market. The technology can increase market adoption of solar by removing aesthetic barriers at low cost and creating significant new opportunities for local manufacturers and installers."

MLM is also critical for maintaining the highest system performance over time. MLM requires a means of communication between each solar module and a remote computer or user interface device. Two such means are currently used: radio and Power-Line Communication (PLC). The awardees introduce a third means of communication: low frequency magnetic fields. This is wireless, but not radio. Magnetic fields penetrate non-ferrous conductors like PV cells, rather than being reflected. Also, magnetic fields don't propagate like radio waves do, so magnetic communication (mag com) has very short range, in this case typically less than three feet. Mag com costs less than radio or PLC. Furthermore, mag com may be able to detect and locate series arc faults at a significantly lower cost. Present methods of detecting series arc faults only determine which string contains the fault, but the new method can determine the specific solar module where the arc fault is occurring. This lowers O&M costs by avoiding a time-consuming search for the fault, and getting the system back on line sooner."

Metal impurities, particularly sodium and potassium originating from the glass used in the solar cell module, have been correlated with the degradation of efficiency over time. In the proposed work, we will probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of impurity atoms within module device layers, including encapsulants, dielectrics, and within the silicon crystal itself and at its interfaces. The objective is to build physical models to explain the macroscale observations of solar cell degradation by parameterizing the evolution of impurity distribution in the module under operating conditions and the electronic impact of these impurities With this understanding in hand, we will develop a platform to predict degradation issues before they arise in emerging materials and architectures and offer design guidelines for new processes to prevent the incorporation of such impurities and/or mitigate their impact in existing wafer to module processes. We take both bottom up and top down approaches to quantify the behavior of impurities as a function of temperature, process-induced strain, and applied potential -- conditions experienced in the field - on the wafer, cell, and module level. We will use intentional contamination to compare effects against ""wild-type"" materials, their chemical analyses, and the degradation trends we observe. The integrated approach in partnership with encapsulant and module manufacturers will provide insights that enable the development of new robust encapsulants, dielectric layers, and interface passivation. A validated simulation platform to predict degradation will accelerate the development of manufacturing processes that avoid potential induced degradation, interconnect failure and extend module lifetimes.

The thermally reduced Mg-Mn-O comprise SoFuel and is cooled down through a recuperative process and stored within a bin until used. Oxidation of SoFuel supplies heat to the user for electricity generation or industrial processing and is then returned to the concentrating solar field where it is regenerated for re-use. In year 1, the team will investigate pellet/particle flowability, reaction kinetics, low order modeling, and the design of reduction and oxidation falling bed reactors. In year 2, the reactors will be fabricated and tested over a wide parameter space to gain an understanding of the performance with different input conditions. During year 3, the reactors will be improved, and the performance will be tested against high order multi-physics modeling. Control systems will be adopted to test performance under continuous operation with a variable on-off heat input using an infrared furnace to simulate variable solar flux conditions. The project will conclude with the production of 5 kg of charged SoFuel that will be shipped from Michigan to Oregon and used to heat the Oregon State University furnace to 1000°C wherein additively manufactured parts will receive heat treatment."

One promising candidate to surpass PERC is tunnel Oxide Passivated poly-Si SiOx contacts (TOPCon), but currently these contacts can only be used on the back side of Si PV cells rather than both sides. This is because the TOPCon layer absorbs some sunlight before it reaches the active PV material, which decreases the cell's efficiency. It is also expensive to screen-print TOPCon layers on very thin poly-Si layers. Recently, the project team succeeded in making a double-sided, screen-printed TOPCon Si PV cell with efficiencies higher than 22%. The team will use these methods to screen-print TOPCon layers on thin poly-Si layers. They will also improve the TOPCon layer itself by decreasing charge recombination and incorporating oxygen to expand its bandgap, which will reduce the amount of sunlight it absorbs.

The inclusion of Vermont as an RTC site will make much-needed cold weather assessments of performance and long-term degradation of solar systems possible, while also offering an exceptional platform for testing system functionality and performance of PV in an enhanced grid environment. Vermont the first state in the nation to deploy a statewide smart grid-offers particular emphasis on smart grid-related testing capabilities including power regulation, VAR sourcing and sinking and even integrated storage management. Development and management of the Vermont RTC will be led by Sandia National Laboratories, with leveraged in-kind support from the partners of Vermont's Center for Energy Transformation and Innovation, a collaborative project comprised of several leading institutions involved in developing Vermont's statewide smart grid.  The Vermont RTC will contain more infrastructure than a typical test-bed PV system and will engage a broader community of suppliers of advanced power electronics, storage systems and communication technologies. Overall, the test bed will bring together PV module and inverter manufacturers, utility engineers and solar integrators to explore the critical issues associated with the integration of solar electricity into the smart grid, resulting in more data, better understanding of grid integration from a systems perspective and improved prospects for commercialization. The Vermont RTC will have the capacity to assess between 100 and 250kW of integrated PV systems. The validation plan encompasses several critical factors, all of which directly influence PV system performance and reliability. These include: system design, baseline module characterization and testing, developing performance coefficients, installation analysis, acceptance testing, performance monitoring and real-time analysis, periodic testing, in-depth analysis and validation of performance and predictions, reliability assessments and a decommissioning study. Although the details of Vermont RTC infrastructure are yet to be determined and will likely change during the operational life of the RTC, the infrastructure will be robust enough to accommodate a variety of functioning PV systems and to allow easy removal and replacement of modules and other components as new evaluations are brought on-line. The RTC will include a well-defined data acquisition system consisting of multiple sensors for various current, voltage, power, temperature and other measurements; a weather station for meteorological measurements, calibration equipment for the measurement systems, communication equipment and additional test equipment for indoor baseline module evaluations prior to installation. Like the other three RTCs, the Vermont RTC will utilize the technology validation plan currently being developed, enabling all four sites to have a uniform methodology of data management and analysis."

Within three years, the overall reliability of the power system with high levels of solar generation will be demonstrated. Strategic Stakeholder Engagement: Achieving large-scale adoption of solar energy will require not only cost reductions in solar technologies but also a favorable environment for interconnecting and operating solar power plants. Realizing economies of scale and high volumes will be difficult if solar penetrations are limited because of reliability, interconnection, or operational rules and requirements. It is therefore essential that the SunShot Initiative engage the regulators, policymakers, utilities, and organizations that establish reliability and operational rules. Policymakers need to know whether high penetrations of solar are technically feasible. Regulators need to understand the reliability and balancing impacts of solar. Utilities need tools and data to study high solar penetrations on their power systems.

The NERC alert resulted from event analyses for grid disturbances that occurred in southem California in August 2016 and October 2017. Those disturbances revealed the use of momentary cessation of transmission connected inverter-based generation- a short time period when they ceased to inject current into the grid, counter to desired transmission operation. The event analyses concluded that, in many cases, the Western Interconnection system models used to determine planning and operating criteria do not reflect the actual behavior of solar plants, resulting in overly optimistic planning assessments and substandard operational responses."

The incorporation of high strength, relatively high modulus ceramic fiber reinforcement within a ceramic matrix produces a material with significantly greater toughness, flaw insensitivity, and strain capability than a monolith, while maintaining high-temperature refractory capabilities. Silicon carbide fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) offers the necessary high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance, and has been identified as a suitable candidate material for the high-flux portion of the solar receiver. This effort encompassed the design of a pressurized ceramic matrix composite (CMC) tubular solar receiver; the demonstrated fabrication of receiver prototypes and material for coupon-level materials testing; and the evaluation of thermal and mechanical materials properties, as well as the structural and thermal performance of the solar receiver prototypes."

Solar Balance of System Cost Reduction,eIQ Energy,SC0011823,Manufacturing and Competitiveness,node/928446,Funding Opportunity,Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Fiscal Year 2015,SBIR/STTR FY15,Inactive,7/28/2016,7/27/2017,"$1,499,620 ",$0.00 ,San Jose,CA,95119,node/790986,37.22976,-121.78637,Gene Krzywinski,"Solar photovoltaic (PV) pricing has two primary components: hardware costs and soft costs. Hardware innovations, volume manufacturing and competition made significant effects on hardware pricing, but now hardware costs have plateaued and a fundamental change is needed to continue that downward pricing trend. While efforts continue to reduce soft and balance of system (BOS) costs, they too will plateau, especially with diverse components that require custom installations for virtually every site. eIQ believes that the industry must drive to standardized, integrated systems that offer ""plug-and-play"" play benefits. eIQ Energy's parallel, HVDC (High Voltage DC) electronics offers to change that by taking the output of each module, regardless of its characteristics, and normalizing it to a high voltage DC buss that can be standardized regardless of the size, location, technology or end use. Each PV-module now becomes a known, independent power building block and by removing the co-dependence of modules and integrating the module and the electronics, standard building blocks can now be realized, leading to further integration and thereby reducing fixed and labor costs. Additionally, because the vBoost now adds current instead of voltage, 2x-3x more power can be transmitted over the same wire as a maximum series string configuration, leading to further cost reduction and installation simplification. The eIQ Energy patented technology works by taking the output of the PV-module, typically 20 V to 120 V, and boosts the voltage to between 320 Vdc and 900 Vdc. This voltage is determined by the part number and the HVDC buss requirements and is typically set by the inverter or the buss attached electronics such as battery storage. On the module side, the vBoost performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to ensure maximum energy extraction from the PV-module. In-circuit elements control the operation of the vBoost, including safety/remote disable, arc fault protection, and, data gathering and transmission. In Phase I, eIQ successfully developed new architecture that took the existing vBoost, encased in a large, aluminum box, and reduced it so that it can now fit within the junction box of the PV-module. Prototypes were made and tested and operate as designed. Cost targets demonstrated that the vBoost electronics are now 1/5th or so of their original cost. During Phase I, eIQ worked closely with key module manufacturers, customers and businesses to develop keen interest in the PV-module integrated vBoost and has received several letters of interest. During this time, eIQ also worked with an innovative module technology company that has developed a light weight, frameless PV-module ideal for eIQ's technology. The vBoost technology is also perfect for integrating renewable energy into microgrids that operate on the emerging 380Vdc buss standard. The technology is also suitable in rural electrification, agriculture and military applications. In Phase II, eIQ will productize the vBoost. This will include optimizing the prototype design, developing the enclosure and interconnections, and working with key partners on commercialization. Once completed, the technology will be able to offer a truly plug and play solution that will standardize PV installations and reduce the BOS and other soft costs. "
Flexible Pipe Couplers for Molten Salt,Brayton Energy,SC0011965,Manufacturing and Competitiveness,node/928446,Funding Opportunity,Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Fiscal Year 2015,SBIR/STTR FY15,Inactive,7/28/2016,7/27/2017,"$1,491,530 ",$0.00 ,Hampton,NH,3842,node/790986,42.944808,-70.823887,Bill Caruso,"Reliable, cost-competitive thermal storage is critical to the growth of the concentrated solar power market. The proposed program focuses on a key component which impacts future trough systems, addressing chronic reliability problems, and providing a pathway to higher plant operating temperatures and resulting higher efficiency. Today's solar trough plants use synthetic oil heat transfer fluids which limit the power plant boiler temperature to 400 degrees Celsius. When the heat transport oil is connected to a thermal salt energy storage system, this temperature is further reduced. The proposed program focuses on developing a rotary coupler for molten salt. With this rotary coupler, direct salt transport through the solar trough can be used, which eliminates the cost and complexity of heat transfer from oil to salt in the storage system. Molten salt has the potential to operate at considerably higher temperatures, from 500 to 650 degrees Celsius, thereby significantly boosting the power plant efficiency. Based on the temperature ratio increase, this represents a roughly 10 percentage-point improvement in steam turbine efficiency. Working closely with the major solar trough manufacturers and plant operators, Brayton has identified the problems with today's rotating joints and performed a detailed characterization of this challenging environment. Working from concept through successful lab testing, Brayton has developed the product from idea to prototype over the course of Phase-I activities. Brayton has followed an aggressive product development path achieving all program goals, including the following accomplishments: 1. Rigorous analytical design and optimization of a novel product solution  2. Manufacturing process development, cost modeling, and capitalization planning. 3. Developed accelerated build, test, and quality assurance processes. 4. Conducted comprehensive laboratory tests, performed failure analysis, and validated life prediction models. 5. Successfully demonstrated 16,000 full diurnal (230 degrees of rotation) cycles on early prototype Salt Couplers. Phase II will improve the flexible Salt Coupler design, perform rigorous laboratory accelerated life testing, and develop robust manufacturing processes for pilot production volumes. The resulting production prototypes will have upgraded functional capabilities including increased pressure and temperature capacity. In cooperation with our established partners, the project will also install up to six (6) field test units, likely operating at 500 degrees Celsius in commercial solar trough plants. A third-party qualification plan with an industry-accepted testing laboratory will prepare the Salt Coupler for initial sales. Brayton's Salt Coupler is an enabling technology for molten salt concentrating solar plants, and this Phase II SBIR will see it evolve from a functioning prototype to a viable, trusted, commercial product."

Maintenance decision making for PV systems is a complex problem in practice which aims to optimally balance the PV performance and the soft cost of maintenance. This project will offer PV system failure prediction capabilities with greatly enhanced accuracies, and will enable PV asset managers to make informed and foresighted decisions that significantly reduce the O&M cost: We aim to reduce the PV asset owner’s O&M budget by 20%, and the annual maintenance cost to below $4 kW per year. The proposed solutions will provide solar asset owners with practical business intelligence about reducing their O&M costs and field-proven strategies for operating their assets most efficiently. Meeting the target level of O&M performance would transform the Commercial & Industrial (C&I) solar marketplace in terms of private investor interest. The key enabler of this project is the massive and hi-fidelity real-world data of a great variety of types collected by Ecogy Energy from their PV assets, using the open-source SolarNetwork platform pioneered by Ecogy’s PIs. These data include power output of PV systems, voltage, current and frequency on both DC and AC sides of inverters, string current from each PV module, solar irradiance, temperatures of inverters and panels, ambient temperature and other weather data, auto-recorded fault codes, maintenance records, and other information of PV systems such as age. Notably, most of the time-series data are collected at a one-minute granularity. Moreover, the data will be from Ecogy Energy’s PV assets in a diverse set of states across the U.S., representing different climate conditions. Learning the intricate information from such heterogeneous and fine-grained data for predicting heterogeneous failures requires advanced ML algorithms, which is the focus of this project. We will first analyze the correlation of different data sources and the predictability of all different failure events from the data. This knowledge will help us structure the subsequent learning algorithm design to be more efficient. Next, we will perform unsupervised learning, without using any event labels, to train anomaly predictors. Specifically, we will design pseudo tasks of predicting certain values of the data sources where the training labels are built-in. As such, we will obtain a) anomaly detectors, b) anomaly classifiers for heterogeneous events, c) pre-trained features to efficiently represent the data, and d) anomaly labels which will be used to augment the event label set. Based on the augmented label set, we will then perform supervised learning for incipient failure prediction, where the pre-trained features will be used. For predicting rare events for which the labels are very limited, we will perform model-based simulations to augment the data set, and then train predictors based on it. We will further perform fusion of different predictors including existing methods to further boost the performance, trained in an end-to-end fashion. To ensure broad applicability of the developed results, we will enhance a) predictor transferability across different assets by transfer learning, and b) predictor adaptability under different levels of data availability and quality.

Linking process and device architecture to studies of basic mechanisms that impact stability and metastability along with the development of rapid device stability testing approaches to accelerate improved device designs and processes will be a focus of these activities. The tight coupling of activities across stability, manufacturability and efficiency consideration related to material composition and process link work on stability directly to efforts to understand performance (efficiency and stability). Thus, work on both single junction and all-perovskite tandems, as well as considerations for their production will directly consider aspect of materials formation, heterogeneity, processing and integration (manufacturing) that cause or mitigate degradation mechanism for high performance PSC tandems and single junctions.

Core partners will provide a representative for DuraMAT's leadership team, lead a core objective, and be eligible to lead core DuraMAT research projects. The core participant institutions- SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (SLAC), Stanford University (SU), and Arizona State University (ASU) - have unique capabilities in areas relevant to DuraMat and are eligible to participate in all DuraMAT projects. The DuraMAT Consortium brings together DOE national lab and university research capabilities with the photovoltaic (PV) and supply-chain industries to accelerate a sustainable, just, and equitable transition to zero carbon electricity generation by 2035 through our five core objectives: development of a central data resource for PV modules, multi-scale and multi-physics modeling, disruptive acceleration science, forensic tools for fielded modules, and materials solutions for more durable, reliable, and resilient modules. DuraMAT leverages the decades of experience, expertise, and world-class facilities at the national laboratories to create a “one-stop-shop” for timely solutions to critical barriers limiting module reliability and durability. In its first five years, DuraMat has become a trusted partner for the US industry. The core objectives have been defined in partnership with DuraMat's Industry Advisory Board (IAB) and are long term research objectives that are expected to continue through DuraMat 2.0. Selection and funding of specific projects however are dynamic, allowing the consortium the flexibility to address the most current and pressing industry concerns. DuraMAT funding supports research projects through a number of different competitive processes described in this TWP. All of the core objectives are focused on the DuraMAT goal of accelerating a sustainable, just and equitable transition to zero carbon electricity generation by 2035 by addressing these two questions: (1) Which materials and module designs will enable sustainable, high energy yield 50-year modules, and how do we ensure that these new modules are not going to fail prematurely? What triggers wear out, defined as a rapid increase in degradation at end of life, and what are the characteristics, rates, and mechnisms of long term degradation in PV modules? In close collaboration with the IAB, DuraMat 2 has identified understanding which materials and packaging designs will enable high energy yield modules with the potential for 50-year lifetimes and identifying long term degradation mechanisms and wear out failures as our highest priorities. Building confidence in 50 year modules requires an understanding of early failures and end of life wear out. Our planned work in DuraMAT 2 includes: •	De-risking high yield modules and screening them for weaknesses that lead to early failure.; •	Identifying the triggers and dominant contributors to wear out failures;.•	Understanding the role of polymeric materials in wear out and long term degradation;.•	Development of predictive degradation models integrating cell and packaging degradation with environmental stressors;•	Quantitatively relating accelerated testing performance with expected field performance ;•	Continued study of bifacial modules, glass glass packaging, and impacts of high energy yield module design;•	Continued development of new accelerated testing methods, modeling approaches, and scalable forensics;•	Development of materials solutions and designs to enable new applications and address known risks;•	Development of data science tools and methods to quickly identify trends in dependence of PV system and module reliability and on module material and design technologies. Both the long term and the early stage de-risking projects will leverage our cutting edge data analytics and processing tools, along wit"

Tandems can either be made by combining two different bandgaps of a class of semiconductor absorber (e.g., III-V or perovskite materials that can be made with multiple bandgaps) or by combining dissimilar photovoltaic materials to create “hybrid tandems.” There are many ways to fabricate a tandem cell or module in terms of materials used, configuration, and terminal connection. While champion cells with areas less than or equal to 1 cm2 are routinely being demonstrated, it is significantly more challenging to translate these advances into modules. There are questions about module fabrication, testing, and reliability that are hard to answer without actually fabricating prototypes. National lab research plays a critical role in “bridging the gap” between university led low TRL efforts and commercialization by fabricating and testing prototypes with realistic configurations and test conditions.
