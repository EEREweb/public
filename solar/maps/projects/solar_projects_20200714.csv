The lattice traps light at frequencies that boost the cells' ability to generate electricity from light. Furthermore, the cells are made with a nanocrystalline and amorphous silicon superlattice. Combining a superlattice with the photonic structure increases light absorption in a very thin silicon film. The amorphous silicon portion of the structure enhances light absorption; the nanocrystalline part helps to transport light-generated electrons. Using these breakthroughs, large-area thin sheets of repeating nano- and microsized structures can be designed to absorb, convert, re-emit, and guide light.

Commercial solutions are not yet widely available to provide optimal use of combined on-site resources locally, while at the same time optimizing their value to the electric power distribution system as well. Solutions still tend to be very customized and follow very traditional approaches to controlling resources that are very sub- optimal. Further, there is little or no coordination at all with the electric utility as this is very much an emerging area. Approaches used in other fields such as the process industries and aerospace provide powerful techniques for multivariable control problems such as the coordination and optimal control and dispatch of multiple distributed energy resources. In Phase I, the Developing Optimal Control Technology for Distributed Energy Resources (DOCTdER) project will formulate local and grid-connected distributed energy resource integration and coordination as an optimal control problem, develop a generalizable, scalable framework and architecture and design to accommodate multiple DER, and develop in simulation a pilot of this for the limited case of solar PV generation and building loads, and test it for performance improvement potential."

The proposed program focuses on a key component which impacts future trough systems, addressing chronic reliability problems, and providing a pathway to higher plant operating temperatures and resulting higher efficiency. Today's solar trough plants use synthetic oil heat transfer fluids which limit the power plant boiler temperature to 400&deg;C. When the heat transport oil is connected to a thermal salt energy storage system, this temperature is further reduced. The proposed program focuses on developing a rotary coupler for molten salt. With this rotary coupler, direct salt transport through the solar trough can be used, which eliminates the cost and complexity of heat transfer from oil to salt in the storage system. Molten salt has the potential to operate at considerably higher temperatures, from 500 to 650&deg;C, thereby significantly boosting the power plant efficiency. Based on the temperature ratio increase, this represents a roughly 10 percentage-point improvement in steam turbine efficiency. Working closely with the major solar trough manufacturers and plant operators, Brayton has identified the problems with today's rotating joints and performed a detailed characterization of this challenging environment. Working from concept through successful lab testing, Brayton has developed the product from idea to prototype over the course of Phase-I activities. Brayton has followed an aggressive product development path achieving all program goals, including the following accomplishments: 1. Rigorous analytical design and optimization of a novel product solution  2. Manufacturing process development, cost modeling, and capitalization planning. 3. Developed accelerated build, test, and quality assurance processes. 4. Conducted comprehensive laboratory tests, performed failure analysis, and validated life prediction models. 5. Successfully demonstrated 16,000 full diurnal (230&deg; of rotation) cycles on early prototype Salt Couplers. Phase II will improve the flexible Salt Coupler design, perform rigorous laboratory accelerated life testing, and develop robust manufacturing processes for pilot production volumes. The resulting production prototypes will have upgraded functional capabilities including increased pressure and temperature capacity. In cooperation with our established partners, the project will also install up to six (6) field test units, likely operating at 500&deg;C in commercial solar trough plants. A third-party qualification plan with an industry-accepted testing laboratory will prepare the Salt Coupler for initial sales. Brayton's Salt Coupler is an enabling technology for molten salt concentrating solar plants, and this Phase II SBIR will see it evolve from a functioning prototype to a viable, trusted, commercial product."

Hardware innovations, volume manufacturing and competition made significant effects on hardware pricing, but now hardware costs are plateau&rsquo;d and a fundamental change is needed to continue that downward pricing trend. While efforts continue to reduce soft and balance of system (BOS) costs, they too will plateau, especially with diverse components that require custom installations for virtually every site. eIQ believes that the industry must drive to standardized, integrated systems that offer plug&rsquo;n&rsquo;play benefits. eIQ Energy&rsquo;s parallel, HVDC (High Voltage DC) electronics offers to change that by taking the output of each module, regardless of its characteristics, and normalizing it to a high voltage DC buss that can be standardized regardless of the size, location, technology or end use. Each PV-module now becomes a known, independent power building block and by removing the co-dependence of modules and integrating the module and the electronics, standard building blocks can now be realized, leading to further integration and thereby reducing fixed and labor costs. Additionally, because the vBoost now adds current instead of voltage, 2x-3x more power can be transmitted over the same wire as a maximum series string configuration, leading to further cost reduction and installation simplification. The eIQ Energy patented technology works by taking the output of the PV-module, typically 20V to 120V, and boosts the voltage to between 320Vdc and 900Vdc. This voltage is determined by the part number and the HVDC buss requirements and is typically set by the inverter or the buss attached electronics such as battery storage. On the module side, the vBoost performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to ensure maximum energy extraction from the PV-module. In-circuit elements control the operation of the vBoost, including safety/remote disable, arc fault protection, and, data gathering and transmission. In Phase I, eIQ successfully developed new architecture that took the existing vBoost, encased in a large, aluminum box, and reduced it so that it can now fit within the junction box of the PV-module. Prototypes were made and tested and operate as designed. Cost targets demonstrated that the vBoost electronics are now 1/5th or so of their original cost. During Phase I, eIQ worked closely with key module manufacturers, customers and businesses to develop keen interest in the PV-module integrated vBoost and has received several letters of interest. During this time, eIQ also worked with an innovative module technology company that has developed a light weight, frameless PV-module ideal for eIQ&rsquo;s technology. The vBoost technology is also perfect for integrating renewable energy into microgrids that operate on the emerging 380Vdc buss standard. The technology is also suitable in rural electrification, agriculture and military applications. In Phase II, eIQ will productize the vBoost. This will include optimizing the prototype design, developing the enclosure and interconnections, and working with key partners on commercialization. Once completed, the technology will be able to offer a truly plug and play solution that will standardize PV installations and reduce the BOS and other soft costs.

Front-surface reflectors are known to maximize reflectance but have never been successfully developed for CSP. Abengoa Solar recently tried to develop a front-surface reflector where the silver reflective layer was protected with a transparent vacuum-deposited oxide layer. The project was not successful. The Abengoa Final Report1 noted “severe degradation of the barrier layer during the water permeation test”. Thanks to the surface science work of Affinito and Hilliard2 we now understand why. Their seminal work provided a detailed understanding of why permeation through thin vacuum-deposited oxides is much higher than expected; and, they explained how limited permeation is required by nanoporosity found within virtually all such thin oxide layers.
[Recognizing that the root problem is the intrinsic nano-morphology of vacuum coated oxides, Affinito and Hilliard showed that permeation can be dramatically reduced (20 to 100 X) by filling/plugging these nanostructures with a polymeric coating that infiltrates into these nanostructures. This proposed solution, now called “Ultra-Barriers” as a general class, has been supported by many subsequent peer-reviewed papers (see attached “Ultra-Barrier References”). The ultra-barrier structure not only solves the permeability problem but also enhances the mechanical robustness of the barrier and makes it more reproducible. We will use these attributes to create a durable front-surface reflector, an innovative approach within the CSP realm.]
The protective coating of a front-surface mirror must not only have ultra-low permeability, but also have outdoor weatherability and abrasion resistance. This is where SST's recent SunShot Incubator nanocoating research3 adds value. [This research identified a nanoparticle infused polymeric coating that has outdoor weatherability and abrasion resistance once it is UV cured. The uncured polymeric nanocoating can be coated over the vacuum-deposited oxide layer (with the oxide deposited over the silver onto a polyester substrate, all in a single pass) to fill/plug the oxide nanostructures, followed by UV curing to polymerize it within and atop the oxide layer. The UV-curable nanocoating is a critical ingredient in this reflector stack, but so is the oxide layer. Polymer/silver interfaces degrade after lengthy UV exposure, so either the UV must be screened out or the silver layer must be separated from the polymer. Screening out the UV results in about a 4% loss in reflectance, so is undesirable. Our construction uses the oxide layer to separate the silver from the polymeric nanocoating, a critical feature of the design. And since our innovative construction also has a low-permeability ultra-barrier and a weatherable abrasion-resistant outermost layer, the net result is a front-surface reflector with all the critical attributes. Indeed, achieving all these features using a construction that is highly manufacturable and mechanically robust is a fundamental objective of our innovative project.]"

to reduced drag, reduced corrosion and
wear, reduced chemical fouling, oleophobicity

Furthermore, by reducing drag, the effective
flow rate of the fluid can be increased for the same pumping power which also leads to increased
convective heat transfer in the receiver. Through leveraging these multifunctional advantages
offered by the novel surfaces, the goal is to increase the overall efficiency and lifetime

The down-converting layer converts high-energy photons, which are normally reflected or inefficiently collected, into multiple lower energy photons. This enables the more efficient conversion of energy by the underlying photovoltaic material which can double the current generated by the solar cell. This project will develop and optimize quantum-cutting precursor ink formulations and large-area solution-deposition techniques. Together, these techniques will enable the integration of these high-efficiency quantum-cutting down conversion layers onto the surfaces of commercially available silicon PV cells to realize low-cost, high-efficiency PV technologies."

Proposed technology: A solar transparent, thermally insulating cover that enables a near-black receiver to operate efficiently (>85%) at elevated temperatures (700 C), under low solar concentration (60x). Specifically, we propose to develop a functionalized aerogel, coated with a conformal ultrathin plasmonic layer of aluminum doped zinc oxide (AZO) using atomic layer deposition (ALD), that is transparent to sunlight but absorbs thermal radiation (Fig. 1a). The conformal ALD layer serves two purposes: (1) it provides a kinetic barrier that stabilizes the structure at elevated temperatures, and (2) it prevents heat from escaping the receiver through mid-infrared bands (2-5 &mu;m) that are not absorbed by silica. The plasmonic nature of AZO allows very thin layers (1-5 nm) to significantly absorb in the desired band and suppress re-radiation losses (Fig. 1c), without significantly increasing the non-radiative thermal conductivity of the aerogel (which scales with density). The aerogel pore size and AZO thickness will be tuned to allow sunlight to transmit to the heated absorber."

molten chloride salt. Metal is stable when in contact with molten salt pretreated to be free of
oxidizing impurities (like water and oxygen). However, oxygen and water can re-enter purified
molten salt if air leaks into the containers in the CSP system. We propose to electrochemically
detect oxidants and then arrest corrosion via one or more of 3 strategies: 1) by removing oxidant
with a zirconium metal getter Zr(s) with fixed gettering power (Ered = -1.5V vs NHE for Zr4+(aq)
+ 4 e- ? Zr(s)); 2) by an electrochemical getter, i.e., electrochemically setting a cathode in the
salt to a reducing potential of -1.5 V vs NHE to remove oxidants by electrochemical reduction.
For this second case, the “gettering power” can be varied by varying the cathode potential.; and
3) by arresting metal corrosion by cathodic protection (using a power supply to apply a negative
potential) to metal surface INSIDE the pipe. Although this this third strategy can remove
oxidant from molten salt, the intent is NOT to remove oxidants from salt but is to use electrical
power to stop metal ionization and maintain the metallic state of the metal surface INSIDE a
pipe. Cathodic protection is well known for preserving the metallic state of the surface

has never been done before. The objective will be met using two tools developed by the UA team
during the MURI program, namely: 1) a reference electrode for potential sensing and control of
the potential of metal in molten salt; and 2) the gas manifold with gas sensors (see Fig.1) to
assess performance and optimize performance of zirconium and electrochemical getters to
preserve conditions that give corrosion rates of less than 50 micron per year."

We still rely mostly on humans to manage complex data for decisions ranging from project selection to construction management to operational performance. SunPower sees opportunities to change the way that companies collect, filter, and process data by using a combination of software and hardware automation. The impact of automated tools could lower utility-scale PV system LCOE from balance-of-systems cost savings caused by more intelligent decisions during project design, more efficient deployments, and faster construction. These savings will bring the industry closer to achieving the DOE's 2020 cost target of 6 cents per kWh."

MLM is also critical for maintaining the highest system performance over time. MLM requires a means of communication between each solar module and a remote computer or user interface device. Two such means are currently used: radio and Power-Line Communication (PLC). The awardees introduce a third means of communication: low frequency magnetic fields. This is wireless, but not radio. Magnetic fields penetrate non-ferrous conductors like PV cells, rather than being reflected. Also, magnetic fields don't propagate like radio waves do, so magnetic communication (mag com) has very short range, in this case typically less than three feet. Mag com costs less than radio or PLC. Furthermore, mag com may be able to detect and locate series arc faults at a significantly lower cost. Present methods of detecting series arc faults only determine which string contains the fault, but the new method can determine the specific solar module where the arc fault is occurring. This lowers O&M costs by avoiding a time-consuming search for the fault, and getting the system back on line sooner."

The Vermont RTC will have the capacity to assess between 100 and 250kW of integrated PV systems. The validation plan encompasses several critical factors, all of which directly influence PV system performance and reliability. These include: system design, baseline module characterization and testing, developing performance coefficients, installation analysis, acceptance testing, performance monitoring and real-time analysis, periodic testing, in-depth analysis and validation of performance and predictions, reliability assessments and a decommissioning study. Although the details of Vermont RTC infrastructure are yet to be determined and will likely change during the operational life of the RTC, the infrastructure will be robust enough to accommodate a variety of functioning PV systems and to allow easy removal and replacement of modules and other components as new evaluations are brought on-line. The RTC will include a well-defined data acquisition system consisting of multiple sensors for various current, voltage, power, temperature and other measurements; a weather station for meteorological measurements, calibration equipment for the measurement systems, communication equipment and additional test equipment for indoor baseline module evaluations prior to installation. Like the other three RTCs, the Vermont RTC will utilize the technology validation plan currently being developed, enabling all four sites to have a uniform methodology of data management and analysis."

Within three years, the overall reliability of the power system with high levels of solar generation will be demonstrated. Strategic Stakeholder Engagement: Achieving large-scale adoption of solar energy will require not only cost reductions in solar technologies but also a favorable environment for interconnecting and operating solar power plants. Realizing economies of scale and high volumes will be difficult if solar penetrations are limited because of reliability, interconnection, or operational rules and requirements. It is therefore essential that the SunShot Initiative engage the regulators, policymakers, utilities, and organizations that establish reliability and operational rules. Policymakers need to know whether high penetrations of solar are technically feasible. Regulators need to understand the reliability and balancing impacts of solar. Utilities need tools and data to study high solar penetrations on their power systems.

Metal impurities, particularly sodium and potassium originating from the glass used in the solar cell module, have been correlated with the degradation of efficiency over time. In the proposed work, we will probe the thermodynamics and kinetics of impurity atoms within module device layers, including encapsulants, dielectrics, and within the silicon crystal itself and at its interfaces. The objective is to build physical models to explain the macroscale observations of solar cell degradation by parameterizing the evolution of impurity distribution in the module under operating conditions and the electronic impact of these impurities With this understanding in hand, we will develop a platform to predict degradation issues before they arise in emerging materials and architectures and offer design guidelines for new processes to prevent the incorporation of such impurities and/or mitigate their impact in existing wafer to module processes. We take both bottom up and top down approaches to quantify the behavior of impurities as a function of temperature, process-induced strain, and applied potential -- conditions experienced in the field - on the wafer, cell, and module level. We will use intentional contamination to compare effects against “wild-type” materials, their chemical analyses, and the degradation trends we observe. The integrated approach in partnership with encapsulant and module manufacturers will provide insights that enable the development of new robust encapsulants, dielectric layers, and interface passivation. A validated simulation platform to predict degradation will accelerate the development of manufacturing processes that avoid potential induced degradation, interconnect failure and extend module lifetimes. By advancing the fundamental understanding of degradation mechanisms in low-cost silicon solar cell materials, the proposed research has the potential to help drive down the levelized cost of solar energy."

This project targets this problem through the development of a template module package for perovskite solar cells and building out of outdoor testing facilities and equipment. These capabilities will bridge lab scale experiments to module level questions addressing both packaging along with environmental impact to cells. This work will enable real world outdoor test required to de-risk perovskites and other innovations in photovoltaic modules."

conventional, low-cost containment and
piping alloys such as stainless steel or Inconel
to be used with the working fluids
in high temperature concentrating solar
power (CSP) applications. The textured
surfaces will provide for non-wetting of
the corrosive fluids with the surface, leading
to reduced drag, reduced corrosion and
wear, reduced chemical fouling, oleophobicity
and reduced heat loss to ambient.
Furthermore, by reducing drag, the effective
flow rate of the fluid can be increased for the same pumping power which also leads to increased
convective heat transfer in the receiver. Through leveraging these multifunctional advantages
offered by the novel surfaces, the goal is to increase the overall efficiency and lifetime
of next gen CSP plants. The proposed fabrication technique for the coatings is based on a novel
electrodeposition approach that allows for fabrication of multi-scaled, fractal textured surfaces
directly on metallic substrates. Since the surfaces are fabricated integrally on the substrate, the
resulting coatings are robust and durable under operating conditions and preserve the thermal properties
of the substrate. The proposed technology offers unique possibilities for addressing the key
challenges in developing next generation CSP technologies"

While the performance of land-based PV systems (LPV) can be effectively predicted, little work has been done on how, or if, these same evaluation methodologies translate to FPV. Additionally, studies evaluating the durability of FPV and its ecological impacts on water quality and biodiversity are scarce.

Project Overview

This project develops a thought leadership community for inclusive financial innovation aimed to empower low-and-moderate income (LMI) households' ability to participate in the new (solar) energy economy. The project focuses on a new class of financial products described as flexible financial credit agreements (FFCAs). FFCAs are envisioned as financial and/or digital products targeted for LMI customers. As an example, FFCAs may provide innovative options to support the contractual relationship between a solar project and the LMI customers. FFCAs can address several underlying barriers to solar by LMI customers such as long-term contracting requirements, non-transferable solar subscriptions, low credit scores, seasonal income fluctuations, product skepticism by non-adopters, and limited mechanisms to multiply or leverage the economic benefits from a solar project. The project team will mobilize a wide-ranging network of industry advisors, financing innovators, and practitioners to describe and pursue FFCA opportunities and develop a plan to sustain this industry effort beyond the project's period of performance. The team will seek out funding opportunities to support long-term FFCA activities and stand up a self-sustained industry-led effort."

The SoFuel can directly supply up to 1300?C heat to an adjacent power plant for electricity generation or industrial heating. The production of SoFuel occurs within a cylindrical cavity chemical reactor that captures concentrated solar radiation from a solar field. Highly reactive magnesium manganese oxide (Mg-Mn-O) resides within the cylindrical cavity chemical reactor and undergoes thermal reduction as the temperature exceeds 1350&amp;#xB0;C. The thermally reduced Mg-Mn-O comprise SoFuel and is cooled down through a recuperative process and stored within a bin until used. Oxidation of SoFuel supplies heat to the user for electricity generation or industrial processing and is then returned to the concentrating solar field where it is regenerated for re-use. In year 1, the team will investigate pellet/particle flowability, reaction kinetics, low order modeling, and the design of reduction and oxidation falling bed reactors. In year 2, the reactors will be fabricated and tested over a wide parameter space to gain an understanding of the performance with different input conditions. During year 3, the reactors will be improved, and the performance will be tested against high order multi-physics modeling. Control systems will be adopted to test performance under continuous operation with a variable on-off heat input using an infrared furnace to simulate variable solar flux conditions. The project will conclude with the production of 5 kg of charged SoFuel that will be shipped from Michigan to Oregon and used to heat the Oregon State University furnace to 1000?C wherein additively manufactured parts will receive heat treatment.&amp;#xA;&amp;#x9;&amp;#xA;"

PV field soiling sensors are used extensively by industry to identify optimal times for O&amp;M cleaning, to backstop field performance guarantees, and to accurately predict PV production during the project development and prospecting phase. So far, the community has been monitoring soiling at PV sites mainly by using soiling stations generally made of two PV devices (cells or modules), one of which is left to soil naturally, while the other is regularly cleaned. Soiling stations require frequent cleanings and careful maintenance in order to produce low uncertainty and reliable data, thus adding substantial costs. A new class of low-maintenance soiling stations has recently been launched in the market to lower the cost and increase the reliability of soiling monitoring. However, the calibration, accuracy, and durability of these systems must still be evaluated in regards to correlations with long term measurements of PV soiling loss at installations. NREL has invented a novel soiling sensor, named "DUSST" (Detector Unit for Soiling Spectral Transmittance), that is maintenance/water free, easy to use, and is made of standard inexpensive components, to reduce the price of the sensor and increase the reliability. When the sunlight reaches the soiling particles, part of it is transmitted and hits the PV material, while part of it is absorbed or reflected. DUSST uses a photovoltaic detector (the same as PV) and measures the same transmitted component of the light as seen by PV: transmittance is often larger than the sum of absorbance and reflectance, and its measurement is generally less noisy than a reflectance signal, meaning that DUSST achieves an excellent signal-to-noise ratio. In addition, DUSST uses a stable light source to quantify soiling, instead of the constantly varying sunlight used by typical soiling stations/sensors. The need to determine the intensity of the sunlight makes it necessary to regularly clean a reference cells in a typical soiling station, while regular cleanings or maintenance is not required for a correct operation of DUSST."
