First, the introduction of internal insulation within the tank will reduce the temperature of the steel pressure boundary enabling designers to use less expensive alloys.

MLM is also critical for maintaining the highest system performance over time. MLM requires a means of communication between each solar module and a remote computer or user interface device. Two such means are currently used: radio and Power-Line Communication (PLC). The awardees introduce a third means of communication: low frequency magnetic fields. This is wireless, but not radio. Magnetic fields penetrate non-ferrous conductors like PV cells, rather than being reflected. Also, magnetic fields don't propagate like radio waves do, so magnetic communication (mag com) has very short range, in this case typically less than three feet. Mag com costs less than radio or PLC. Furthermore, mag com may be able to detect and locate series arc faults at a significantly lower cost. Present methods of detecting series arc faults only determine which string contains the fault, but the new method can determine the specific solar module where the arc fault is occurring. This lowers O&M costs by avoiding a time-consuming search for the fault, and getting the system back on line sooner."

"High-Performance Self-Cleaning, Antireflective, and Anti-fog Coating for PV Glass to Increase Module Output and Decrease BOS Costs",WattGlass,EE0007582,Technology to Market,node/928446,Funding Opportunity,"Technology to Market 2: Incubator 11, SolarMat 4",Incubator 11,Active,2016,"$679,413 ",Fayetteville,AR,72701-7175,node/2040058,36.06258,-94.157426,Corey Thompson,"This project is further developing an antireflective coating for the top glass of solar modules. The coating has a refractive index closer to that of glass, leading to higher transmission and higher module power. This project allows WattGlass to test the coating on panels from a number of manufacturers in order to gauge wattage improvements achieved over competing coatings. Modules with the coating will be tested in various regions to evaluate increases in panel performance due to the antireflective coating and reductions in soiling rate due to the superhydrophilic nature of the coating."

The Influence of Novel Behavioral Strategies in Promoting the Diffusion of Solar Energy,Yale University,EE0006128,Soft Costs,node/791371,Funding Opportunity,Solar Energy Evolution and Diffusion Studies,SEEDS,Inactive,2013,"$1,899,081 ",New Haven,CT,06501-0001,node/791446,41.31,-72.93,Kenneth Gillingham,"The goal of this project is to quantify the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and scalability of Solarize programs that communities across the U.S. are instituting. In these programs, homeowners band together to collectively purchase rooftop solar systems. This project will research these and other strategies that leverage social interactions to accelerate diffusion of solar technologies. Researchers from Yale University and New York University are designing and running a series of randomized field trials to study the new Solarize Connecticut program. The field tests are being implemented with Yale's partner, SmartPower."

The project also quantifies the benefits to the electricity grid from programs that expedite and increase deployment of solar energy in areas where solar provides additional value to the grid. In addition, pilot projects within three states test the models developed under this work in the field with the intent to use lessons learned from messaging studies to encourage more populations to go solar, particularly in areas of high grid congestion."

Specifically, Zep will address the inefficiencies in both labor and materials costs imposed by the use of mostly-unnecessary structural aluminum and steel in today's ground mount PV installations. Zep has already demonstrated its effectiveness in driving down costs (5x reductions in residential roof install time, 80% part-counts reductions for commercial rooftop arrays) and promoting adoption (three of the top ten PV manufacturers in the world now license Zep technology) for its standards-oriented PV installation platform. The company now proposes to bring these results and momentum to the rapidly-growing commercial roof and ground mount arenas, and extend the benefits of standardization to a broad cross-section of industry vendors (module, micro-electronics, wiring, software, and services vendors)."
