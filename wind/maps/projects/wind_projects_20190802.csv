Deployed by individuals, businesses, communities, and electric utilities, distributed wind refers to any size wind turbine or small array of turbines that generates power for local or on-site use. Relative to utility-scale wind and other distributed energy resources such as photovoltaics, market growth for DW systems has been hindered by outdated and untested technologies; high hardware costs; inaccurate resource and performance assessment; high non-hardware balance-of-system costs; and an unclear understanding of the DW market pathways and potential opportunities.
The purpose of this project is to drive innovation in wind technologies designed for distributed energy applications and develop a fundamental understanding of the market opportunity for planning a more robust portfolio to support DW cost reduction and market development. Primary project objectives include 1) reducing DW system LCOE and 2) increasing the number of small and medium scale wind technologies tested to nation standards for certification. A component of this task is the Competitiveness Improvement Project, which is an annual competitive solicitation concentrating on turbine testing, advanced manufacturing, and system optimization for small and medium size wind turbine technology.

Because there are many such approximations in all atmospheric models, it was generally difficult to identify which ones were the largest contributors to model uncertainty. Alternatively, it was possible that there were systematic shortcomings in the parameterizations themselves—such as implicit assumptions related to the complexity of the terrain.

This requires mapping project finance related uncertainty to identify the major pre-construction risks for investors. PRUF encompasses a wide range of risk reduction activities including performance benchmarking, quantification of performance variability, and operations research. The scope of PRUF includes providing support to related industry working groups, such as the Power Curve Working Group and the Consortium for Advancement of Remote Sensing to help identify the best pathways to reduce uncertainty associated with power curves and resource measurements. The primary focus area of PRUF is the Wind Plant Performance Prediction (WP3) Benchmarking activity, which is a first of its kind data sharing and analysis initiative between major wind industry stakeholders.
The WP3 task can have a significant positive near term impact on wind deployment and LCOE—lessons learned through WP3 can rapidly find their way into industry standards and practices, given the close working relationship between project stakeholders. WP3 aggregates energy yield predictions from consultants and provides critical feedback on the accuracy and uncertainty of those predictions. This facilitates greater investor confidence in the predicted outcomes, and therefore reduces risk premiums associated with wind project investment. Because the PRUF team works closely with industry leading consultants to identify modeling deficiencies, WP3 is able to accelerate the adoption of new methods for estimating energy production. There are three project objectives for the benchmark effort that will accomplish the above outcomes:

O&M costs represent approximately 30% of wind LCOE, with maintenance comprising roughly half of that, and large component failures responsible for the majority of maintenance costs. Blades, for example, are designed for a 20-year life while blade replacements affect approximately 1-3% of the fleet per year, and typically cost $200,000 to $300,000 per replacement. The cost of these replacements is spread out over OEMs, owner-operators, and insurance companies, affecting all major components of LCOE. Furthermore, the causes are varied and range from design and manufacturing errors, to transportation and installation damage, to operational damage. The cost of these failures can be only be alleviated by prevention or repair. With a “safe life” design philosophy, components are designed to a certain lifetime based on assumptions about the strength of materials, the quality of the manufacturing process, and the environment that the components will operate in. With a “durability and damage tolerant” design philosophy, effects of defects and damage, inspection technology, repair techniques, and operating environments are known and tightly coupled, such that the current state of the component is continually evaluated. Moving from safe-life to durability-and-damage-tolerant in wind will result in lower cost and cost uncertainty by focusing maintenance effort where and when it is needed, and avoiding large-scale failures, as it has in commercial aerospace. Additionally, the wind industry will soon be facing a large life-extension problem as plants near their original design life. This problem is similar to what commercial aviation faced several decades ago and will likely need this new philosophy to operate turbines reliably and safely for 10 or more additional years. To accomplish this goal, the industry will need to have a validated repertoire of inspection, analysis, and database tools to enable industry participants with the ability to be proactive rather than reactive to address the problems of wind turbine blades with defects. Collection of wind turbine reliability data will allow for high-value investments in the wind industry to lower component failures.

Over the past 5 years, DOE has achieved most of the stated objectives outlined in this document. In 2015, DOE and DOI began developing a new offshore wind strategy aimed at creating an update to the 2011 plan, but based largely on DOE’s 2015 Wind Vision. DOE requested that the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) help develop the new strategy, to be released in 2016, by engaging stakeholders in the U.S. offshore wind industry, providing supporting analysis, and working with the DOE strategy team to develop the final strategy document. This activity is part of DOE’s fundamental mission to support the industry by communicating accurate information and analysis about the technology and economic potential of the emerging offshore wind industry.
A general framework for the new 2016 U.S. offshore wind strategy was provided by the 2015 Wind Vision, which prescribed 86 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy by 2050. However, the Wind Vision was written at a high level and did not provide the details to be translated directly into an actionable strategy for the DOE program, and did not establish a high-resolution baseline for cost, value, or economic potential. Under this activity, NREL provided direct support to DOE and DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management by conducting analysis to support the updated offshore wind strategy. This analysis incorporated NREL’s unique capabilities and expertise in offshore wind resource assessment and economic and market analysis to help DOE assess the current situation in offshore wind and chart a course for the next 5 years. NREL also updated existing data and developed new information that will help the creation and maturation of an offshore sector to the wind industry as described in the Wind Vision. The overall project objectives were to Support the development of a new offshore wind strategy in the context of the Wind Vision and to provide analysis and information to the offshore wind strategy team. These analyses included: 
<ul>
<li>Creating a terminology framework to translate offshore wind energy into oil and gas language.</li>
<li>Updating offshore wind resource potential from the 2010 report.</li>
<li>Reporting on the opportunity space for offshore wind in the coastal energy market to 2050.</li>
<li>Quantifying the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for offshore wind on a geospatial plane.</li>
<li>Identifying pathways towards achieving cost competitiveness.</li>
<li>Building a framework for evaluating economic potential regionally.</li>

This has impeded the wind industry due both to the lack of direct wind observations and to the lack of validation of wind resource modeling offshore. In recent years, wave motion-correcting lidar systems have been demonstrated to be capable of providing wind measurements at hub-heights over the ocean. These instruments, mounted on buoys, are far less costly to procure and deploy than conventional meteorological towers. The purpose of this project is to assist the offshore wind industry by providing previously unavailable hub-height wind and supporting met/ocean data. For example, prior to deployment of DOE’s lidar buoys, there had been limited or no wind and wave resource data in the BOEM designated Wind Energy Areas to allow confident deployment and operation of wind turbines in the offshore environment. Resource assessment data are critical to determining the expected annual energy output from a wind plant as well as proper turbine and plant design. Further, meteorological and oceanographic (metocean) data that are privately obtained for project siting purposes are generally proprietary, which limits further research opportunities and benefits to the wind industry.

The results of this project will be broadly applicable to the industry, ranging from OEMs and blade manufacturers to owner/operators and service companies. At the conclusion of this project we will: 
<ul>
<li>Improve field inspections by assessing the viability of NDI methods to detect in-service damage in wind blades. This knowledge will be transferred to service companies to make NDI more prevalent and more successful at identifying damage. Specifically, this work will develop safer and more cost-effective robot-deployed NDI concepts to expand the inspection capabilities of third-party service companies. One or more of these methods will be selected and used to perform benchtop inspections of specimens with representative, engineered flaws. Based on these results, one NDI method will be integrated into a deployable, proof-of-concept system by collaborating with a robotic crawler company, NDI equipment manufacturer, and wind turbine service company. This proof-of-concept system will be deployed at a wind farm to perform initial field validation test and provide hands-on inspection experience for wind farm operators and service companies.</li>
<li>Quantify best methods to repair defects and damage in wind blades. Currently, many blades are scrapped due to lack of acceptable repairs of structural elements. The project builds on previous effects of defects experimental and modeling work to both determine the applicability of standard composite repair methods and seek to develop improvements specific to the wind industry.</li>
<li>Integrate blade design, manufacturing, and operation into a lifetime value model. The cost of manufacturing and operating a blade over its lifetime compared to the energy that is captured is vital to understanding potential improvements in both rotor design and operational reliability. As these costs are spread over multiple parties, it has been difficult to fully evaluate the effect that new blade technology has on costs This gap will be addressed through the development of a cradle-to-grave cost vs. revenue model.</li>

There is uncertainty in the effect of lightning strikes on carbon fiber spars in wind blades. While lighting strikes are not new to wind, carbon blades are becoming more common. A carbon spar blade may show evidence of the strike entering into the carbon material, but how to find and assess the level of damage is not well known. This task will address that issue by subjecting wind blade carbon fiber samples to lightning level currents and performing NDI and mechanical testing on them to determine inspectability and strength degradation.</li>",Active,gklise@sandia.gov,http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/wind-power/materials-reliability-standards/
1.5.2.001,Wind Turbine Drivetrain Reliability: White-Etching Crack (WEC) Root Cause Analysis,Argonne National Laboratory,Next-Generation Technology Development and Manufacturing,"$2,536,566 ",National Laboratory,Annual Operating Plan,IL,,,2014 &ndash; 2018,/node/778391,"The objective of the project is to reduce operations and maintenance (O&M) costs related to wind turbine drivetrains. The operational conditions of wind turbines present unique design challenges. Low rotor speeds, large bearing sizes, and variability in load and speed can all lead to detrimental tribological contact conditions in gears and bearings. These conditions lead to accelerated failures, such as bearing axial cracks, micropitting, fretting, and scuffing, that are predominant and responsible for the higher than anticipated drivetrain O&M costs. These types of failure modes are not accounted for in design standards; are not preventable using currently applied design, material, and tribological technologies; are not attributable to quality control; are complex in nature; and are generally independent of specific component suppliers. Current solution approaches developed with limited understanding have led to an inefficient process of field trial and error that has cost the industry significant resources and time. Through this project, drivetrain reliability will be increased by characterizing the mechanisms of the predominant and unaccounted failure modes, such as gearbox planetary or white-etch cracking bearing failures and surface-initiated main shaft bearing failures; developing and validating mitigation solutions for them; and developing accurate life models for improved component design specifications. Turbine availability and energy capture will be increased by developing more effective fleet management tools for drivetrain inspection, monitoring, and remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. The project includes five specific tasks as described below:
<ul>
<li>Planetary section failures, although relatively infrequent, are expensive because they typically require a full gearbox replacement with a large crane. The objective of the first task is to understand the causes of planetary bearing failures related to unequal load sharing and then develop and demonstrate planetary design solutions that provide robust load sharing in the wind turbine application.</li>
<li>The most common gearbox failure mode is axial cracks in the raceways of intermediate- and high-speed stage bearings, also called “white-etching cracks” (WECs). WECs cause as much as 71% of the failures and can occur under 20% of the design life. Though they have been reported for over a decade in various industries, the reason for their prevalence in wind turbine gearboxes is not known. The objective of the second task is to characterize the causes of WECs through analysis and testing. Once characterized, appropriate mitigation solutions can be examined—ranging from new bearing materials, coatings, and heat treatments; to improved lubricants; to changes in gearbox designs and to changes in turbine operations.</li>
<li>Main-bearing reliability has been identified as a significant O&M cost driver by owners and operators. Unlike the most common gearbox faults, main bearings typically cannot be replaced uptower and require removal of the rotor system with a large, expensive crane. Very little failure mode information exists in the public domain; however, evidence suggests that main-bearing failures are related to progressive wear modes stemming from micropitting, skewing, skidding, or fretting and not from rolling contact fatigue. The objective of the third task is to characterize the causes of main-bearing progressive wear failures through analysis and testing. Once characterized, appropriate mitigation solutions can be examined.</li>
<li>The fourth task objective is to enhance wind plant O&M practices through the mining of turbine and plant performance data and to improve condition monitoring (CM) technology. The wind industry is rich with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition, high-resolution history, and meteorological tower data, plus event or maintenance reports; however, these collectively are not well explored. </li>
<li>The fifth task objective is to exchange information, including gearbox failure event data, related to drivetrain reliability among industry and national laboratories. The public drivetrain reliability collaborative helps define the technical tasks and propagates outcomes from the tasks to the industry and standards communities.</li>

Wind plant O&M is a $2B to $3B annual market in the United States, and O&M costs are increasing 5% to 10% per year and will continue to grow as the fleet ages and installed capacity grows. The predominant drivetrain component failure modes are gearbox planetary section bearing failures due to unequal load sharing; and gearbox parallel section bearing failures due to white-etching, cracking, and surface-initiated main shaft bearing failures. They occur prematurely, are not accounted for in design standards, typically are not attributable to quality control, and are independent of specific component suppliers. Identifying the mechanisms of failure through testing and analysis; and validating mitigation approaches to improve the inherent reliability of these bearings will reduce drivetrain O&M costs. O&M costs can be further reduced by developing and verifying diagnostic and prognostic tools to increase operational reliability and turbine availability. Owners and operators are the primary beneficiaries of this project. They report that O&M costs are excessive for existing wind plants to the extent that they reduce the anticipated profitability and thus the development of new wind plants. Wind turbine OEMs and component suppliers would also benefit from this work. The wind turbine drivetrain reliability project includes five specific tasks as described below.

However, despite significant research on this topic in recent years, there are still many open questions about what are the most promising application areas as well likely benefits of moving from deterministic to stochastic approaches. 
In this project, Argonne conducted a detailed assessment of how stochastic approaches can be used at different stages in system and market operations, from day-ahead scheduling to real-time dispatch. The Argonne team first conducted a review of existing work and summarized the main results from previous studies while also identifying the main impediments for introducing stochastic methods into operational decisions making. Next, the team developed a systematic set of metrics and a consistent framework to evaluate different scheduling, dispatch, and market operations strategies. They also conducted an initial quantitative evaluation of the potential benefits of stochastic programming approaches compared to traditional deterministic models and other alternatives. 
The case study was conducted on a hypothetical test system, considering a number of realistic constraints and operational procedures. The results of this project provided the electric power industry with better insights into the range of different stochastic methods that can be applied to power system operations, the potential benefits of shifting towards stochastic methods in operations, and also to better appreciate likely challenges, from technical, market, and computational perspectives. 
Overall, the project has expanded the industry’s understanding of potential methods and tools available to address the uncertainty and variability in wind power and other renewable resources, thereby facilitating a more cost effective integration of wind power into the grid. More specifically, the objectives of the project were to: 
<ul>
<li>Classify existing approaches and tools for stochastic grid operations under uncertainty in renewable generation.</li>
<li>Identify the most promising application areas for stochastic approaches in grid operations, considering cost, reliability, market implementation, and computational perspectives.</li>

Previous studies have shown that the technical capabilities of the grid are sufficient to integrate high penetrations of wind energy; however, existing market structures and incentives may hinder access to the physical flexibility available among existing and new resources on the grid. This project examines the fundamental question: How does reliability of future power systems vary depending on wholesale electric market designs?  
Without the ability to represent realistic markets in future models and studies, system operators and regulators will not be able to integrate wind generation efficiently, creating a more difficult and costly transition to a modern electric power system. Therefore, this project took a modeling approach to provide insights into key drivers of wholesale electricity energy, ancillary service, and capacity prices, including resource adequacy level, operating reserve treatment, and price formation rules. The objective of this project is to characterize institutional constraints that impact the costs and reliability of grid operations at both long-term (decadal) and short-term (from hours to minutes and seconds) timescales. 
To address these challenges, the project team has developed analytical approaches to help analyze potential shortcomings caused by current market structures and identify key drivers to operating a cost-effective and reliable electricity market with high shares of wind power. The project has deployed conventional optimization approaches, as well as behavioral modeling techniques. The project has leveraged relationships with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organizations (ISO/RTOs) to comprehensively analyze the performance of existing markets and reliability requirements as well as potential new rules and standards.

Although there is no power transmission link between the NWTC and ESIF, the operational data from the NWTC generation can be “connected” to ESIF via a virtual data link for conducting various combined experiments using the real-time power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) capabilities of the ESIF. This link enables ESIF’s access to real multimegawatt variable generation. The generation of wind and solar photovoltaics along with the existing 7-MVA and two multimegawatt-scale dynamometers creates a unique environment for testing and demonstration of many grid integration aspects of renewable generation, energy storage, protection equipment, advanced controls, and energy management systems. In addition, a new multimegawatt energy storage testing facility at the NWTC can be coupled with the existing variable generation and/or CGI. Connecting both the ESIF and CGI into a combined test bed has increased the value of both facilities, and creates a unique capability for advanced PHIL multimegawatt testing to address challenges of large-scale integration of renewable energy sources in the energy system infrastructure. An important aspect of carrying out combined PHIL experiments utilizing real-time models of various power systems is the ability of NWTC generation to activate certain grid-friendly controls and/or operate on set points generated by ESIF-CGI real-time power system models.

In many areas throughout the world, wind power is supplying up to 20% of total energy demand. In the United States, balancing areas like the Public Service of Colorado have occasions where over 50% of the hourly demand is supplied by wind power. Wind power, particularly variable-speed wind power, which is the majority of all wind plant capacity in the world, is also different from conventional thermal and hydropower-generating technologies as it is not synchronized to the electrical frequency of the power grid and is generally unresponsive to system frequency. The focus of this project is a mitigation strategy that is not often discussed and is in some ways counterintuitive: the use of wind power to support power system reliability by providing active power control (APC) at fast timescales. APC is the adjustment of a resource’s active power in various response timeframes to assist in balancing the generation and load, thereby improving power system reliability. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), along with partners from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the University of Colorado and collaboration from a large international industry stakeholder group, embarked on a comprehensive study to understand the ways in which wind power technology can assist the power system by providing control of its active power output being injected onto the grid. The study includes a number of different power system simulations, control simulations, and actual field tests using turbines at NREL’s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC).

Previous studies have shown that the technical capabilities of the grid are sufficient to integrate high penetrations of wind energy; however, existing market structures and incentives may hinder access to the physical flexibility available among existing and new resources on the grid. This project examines the fundamental question: How does reliability of future power systems vary depending on wholesale electric market designs?  
Without the ability to represent realistic markets in future models and studies, system operators and regulators will not be able to integrate wind generation efficiently, creating a more difficult and costly transition to a modern electric power system. Therefore, this project took a modeling approach to provide insights into key drivers of wholesale electricity energy, ancillary service, and capacity prices, including resource adequacy level, operating reserve treatment, and price formation rules. The objective of this project is to characterize institutional constraints that impact the costs and reliability of grid operations at both long-term (decadal) and short-term (from hours to minutes and seconds) timescales. 
To address these challenges, the project team has developed analytical approaches to help analyze potential shortcomings caused by current market structures and identify key drivers to operating a cost-effective and reliable electricity market with high shares of wind power. The project has deployed conventional optimization approaches, as well as behavioral modeling techniques. The project has leveraged relationships with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and Independent System Operator/Regional Transmission Organizations (ISO/RTOs) to comprehensively analyze the performance of existing markets and reliability requirements as well as potential new rules and standards.

This is becoming more challenging when the proportion of generation from variable and uncertain renewable resources in the system is high. It has been observed recently that the variability of the net load brings two main negative impacts to the power systems: 1) the ramp response of controllable resources becomes taxed, and 2) the frequency of short-term generation scarcity events increases due to ramping capacity shortages.
In real-time power system operations, regulation services provide the only response option for balancing net-load variations on the seconds or minutes timeframe. In the dispatch horizon, “load following” resources are scheduled to provide the most economical solution to the expected level of variation. Currently, the expected level of variation can be met by residual capabilities of controllable resources. The challenge, however, is that the system changes beyond the visibility of the dispatch horizon, leaving the dispatchable resources with sufficient capacity but without ramp capability to respond when needed. This can lead to short-term scarcity events in the system.
This project aims to develop an innovative, integrated, and transformative approach to mitigate the impact of wind ramping by providing flexible ramping products from wind power. The project significantly contributes to the reduction of wind integration costs by making wind power dispatchable and allowing the efficient management of wind ramping characteristics. In addition, industry collaboration allows for testing and methodology validation, accounting for economic and reliability goals, by integrating the proposed methodology into the operations of two independent system operators (ISOs): the California Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT).",Active,brian.smith@nrel.gov,https://www.nrel.gov/wind/

"" target=""_blank"">Baseline Public Acceptance of Wind Survey</a>: The number of homes near wind turbines is growing over time, and there had previously been no comprehensive data on  levels of support, opposition and annoyance and their drivers for communities surrounding wind facilities. This four-year effort (FY15–18) surveyed homeowners near existing U.S. wind projects to provide first-of-its-kind broad-based, unbiased and statistically defensible information on the drivers of acceptance, opposition and annoyance related to local turbines. The analysis of the 1,700-respondent 22-minute survey data was completed in 2018 and a public version of the dataset was released. A component of this project, the prediction of turbine sound audibility and annoyance, became a separate project in FY18 and is discussed below.</li>
<li>Turbine Sound Modeling (TSM): Turbine audibility is an often-regulated component of turbine setbacks from homes and therefore turbine placement. Additionally, turbine sound annoyance is one of the key concerns of communities considering hosting wind turbines. Despite the importance of turbine sound audibility and annoyance, scant verified information existed on the appropriate sound models to be used in the wind project pre-development period to predict the levels of sound community members will likely experience. Nor had there been a thorough effort to examine the correlations between modeled sounds, along with suite of other potential correlates, to community-reported annoyance. For this task, LBNL—in collaboration with a recognized private sound modeling firm—developed models to predict both audibility and annoyance using a suite of wind turbine, environmental, and survey respondent-level characteristics.</li>

Easy-to-permit locations are more difficult to identify, leading developers to move into places closer to population centers or to areas with increased conflicts from a whole host of competing land or offshore uses. Addressing and mitigating these conflicts increases the permitting times, project-specific permitting costs, and the number of projects that run into intractable conflicts that force the abandonment of projects. Again, akin to resource availability, as projects are forced to move to lower-capacity resource sites, projects must overcome increasingly complex challenges as sites with fewer potential conflicts are used. Many of these conflicts are based on real issues that must be addressed in discussions with local leaders and those impacted by the projects. Others, however, are based on perceived conflicts or a lack of easily-accessible information on the potential impacts—both positive and negative. The activities conducted in this project focus on providing fact-based information to help inform wind energy stakeholders about the responsible deployment of wind technology in their communities. These activities are implemented through three specific general objectives:

The Wind Vision included detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, and impacts of achieving and sustaining high wind penetrations nationwide (e.g., 20% by 2030, 35% by 2050). While the report relied on extensive expertise and contributions from the Labs, the wind industry, power system operators, academia, AWEA, WEF, and others, the modeling and impacts assessments focused on the prescribed visionary wind levels and did not explore the policy mechanisms to achieve those levels. While NREL’s state-of-the-art ReEDS capacity expansion model was used in the core impacts analysis for the Wind Vision, the study did not include more-detailed production cost simulations to evaluate implications of systems operations of high wind scenarios. The project built from the Wind Vision and addressed open research questions. The project also applied electric sector analysis to support DOE wind strategic planning in relation to the DOE role in achieving the Wind Vision. The project included two core components, one primarily using the ReEDS model and another using PLEXOS. The ReEDs report looked at potential futures of wind energy under various economic and technology improvement scenarios. It found that, while the wind market faces headwinds associated with the expiration of the production tax credit after 2020, continued aggressive cost reductions through investment in research and development can help drive significant continued deployment between now and 2050.

The objective of the project was to increase the fidelity of the simulation model in order to clearly demonstrate the cost of energy estimates by: 
<ul>
<li>Determining the expected energy delivered.</li>
<li>Determining the loads on the components and therefore the required dimensions of the components.</li>

The proposal initially presented to the DOE had several aims: 
<ul>
<li>to develop controls that overcome key technical barriers to the deployment of deep water floating offshore wind turbines;</li>
<li>to improve annual energy production (AEP) from wind turbines through advanced control strategies (e.g. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-based preview controls, advanced supervisory controls, etc.); and,</li>
<li>to lower the capital costs for both wind turbines and floating foundations through advanced control strategies.</li> 
</ul>
Developing controls that address key challenges facing the use of floating foundations (e.g., extreme wind and wave loading, increased fatigue loads etc.) is vital to reducing the cost of energy of deep water offshore wind plants. Furthermore, many of the control strategies developed under this project are not only applicable to wind turbines installed on floating foundations but are also applicable to turbines atop fixed-bottom foundations or other floating technologies – thereby offering potential LCOE benefits to shallow and transitional water installations as well.
Key performance indicator (KPI) benefits resulting from advanced controls are manifested in LCOE reduction via several avenues. This project utilized enhanced Annual Energy Production (AEP) and Capital Expenses (CAPEX) reduction paths to estimate overall improvement in wind plant LCOE due to advanced controls innovations. CAPEX reduction is realizable by reducing the weight of wind turbine (e.g., blade, tower) and floating substructure (e.g., hull) components. Advanced control technologies were designed to reduce key structural loads thereby reducing component weights. Advanced sensing and controls were also investigated to achieve an optimal trade-off between energy production and structural loads. ",Active,,

</ul> 
Several new technologies had been suggested for taller towers, but none of the options had shown to be cost competitive, as evidenced by the limited use and the inability to eliminate transportation and logistics challenges. The Hexcrete technology puts the manufacturer, contractor, and wind farm owners in charge of how the tower should be prefabricated and erected, avoiding any special transportation requirements. It offers versatilities in the use of materials, connection choice, location of prefabrication, erection sequence, and the possibility of combining concrete with steel tubular segments. Using High Performance Concrete (HPC) and Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC), the technology allowed the base dimension to be limited to that expected for steel tubular towers. Tower dimensions were governed by strength requirement, not fatigue loads, allowing the towers to be designed for 40 to 50 years of design life. Since the entire tower is post-tensioned to the foundation using unbonded tendons, it can also be detensioned and disassembled relatively easily, simplifying the decommissioning of the towers.

This technology could reduce operating costs by decreasing unscheduled downtime due to unplanned maintenance. The objective of this project was to develop a low-cost, online, intelligent prognostic health monitoring system (PHMS) for wind turbines. The PHMS primarily uses current signals acquired from generator terminals or in the wind turbine control system to diagnose and prognose the faults and determine the health condition of the wind turbine system. In addition to current signals, the PHMS can also be used to include vibration signals in wind turbines to provide additional prognostic health monitoring capability and improved diagnosis and prognosis accuracy. Due to the fundamental difference between a wind turbine drivetrain and pitch system, different PHMSs were developed for drivetrains and pitch systems. In this project, the PHMSs developed were demonstrated on two types of wind turbine drivetrains. One type of drivetrain consists of a turbine rotor, blades, and an electrical generator, which are commonly used in direct-drive (no gearbox) wind turbines equipped with permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs). The other type of drivetrain consists of a turbine rotor, blades, a gearbox, and an electrical generator, which are commonly used in wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs).

While radar platforms have been used extensively in meteorological applications, this is the first radar system specifically designed for wind energy research. This new design for a modular and portable system requires less power to operate and can measure larger areas than currently utilized conventional radar systems. The goal of this project was to revolutionize wind farm complex flow measurements. The feasibility of employing radar technology to measure wind plant relevant complex flows (e.g. turbine-to-turbine interaction, and/or turbine inflow and wake flow) was historically illustrated by Texas Tech University using the TTUKa radars. While maintaining unique advantages in resolution, scan speed and maximum range relative to other technologies, the existing TTUKa radars provided limited data availability in many non-precipitating (i.e. clear air) environments, did not operate in an autonomous manner, were susceptible to attenuation in moderate/heavy precipitation, and maintained water vapor and sea salt absorption issues that minimized performance offshore. These inherent limitations reduced the application of the technology to research oriented projects. This incubator project resulted in the development of a new DOE-X prototype radar which maintains similar spatial and temporal resolutions to that of the TTUKa radars, but mitigates the identified limitations leading to the potential for more widespread adoption. 
The new prototype radar will assist DOE and industry partners in developing smart wind farms, where energy extraction and loads mitigation are considered at the plant scale. By providing more reliable complex flow information at sufficient resolution from across an entire wind plant, the new radar technology opens the door for rapid validation of wind plant scale control concepts and related simulations. Given that there is up to a 30% reduction in plant performance due to turbine-to-turbine interaction alone, new optimization concepts at the plant level offer a tremendous opportunity to enhance the output from both new and existing wind plants and significantly lower the cost of energy. 
The developed DOE-X radar provides a cornerstone instrument to assist in this transition. The project complements the Energy Department’s ongoing Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) Initiative, which aims to improve wind plant performance by increasing understanding of how wind moves throughout wind farms.

The deterrent design consisted of a series of ultrasonic pulse generators, or whistles modeled after that of a bat larynx, which responds in a non-linear fashion to small changes in air pressure, allowing for chaotic changes in frequency of sound produced.  The whistles were affixed to a wind turbine blade to passively produce ultrasonic sounds mimicking the spectrotemporal patterns of bat echolocation pulses as turbine blades spin, thereby enhancing the bats’ ability to detect, localize and avoid the moving blades. Initial prototype design were followed by an iterative process of modelling, three-dimensional fabrication, and testing to ensure performance over a range of conditions.

The hypothesis was that bats are coming into contact with wind turbine towers (and are therefore at risk of entering the rotor swept zone) because they perceive or misperceive the wind turbines to be a resource, then altering the tower surfaces may provide an innovative means of reducing mortality risk that does not entail a loss in power production. Incremental reductions in bat mortality may be especially important in areas where take of threatened or endangered species is possible. Furthermore, depending on how effective this technology is at minimizing bat mortality, the texture treatment may be used as a stand-alone minimization solution or in combination with other solutions.
The wind turbine tower coating development and application plan were completed in 2016. Assessing how bats respond to the coating in a controlled flight facility, as well as testing the effectiveness of the tower coating at reducing bat activity, and therefore potentially bat mortality, at operational wind turbines were completed in 2017.

The listing of several bat species as threatened or endangered presents siting and permitting challenges for new facilities and mitigation challenges for existing wind energy facilities. Currently, the only scientifically proven strategy to consistently reduce bat fatalities at wind turbines is operational minimization. Recently published studies indicate that feathering the blades below a higher-than-normal cut-in speed (e.g., 1.5–3.0 m/s above the manufacturer’s cut-in speed) results in an average 50% reduction in bat fatalities compared to normally operating turbines. However, altering turbine operations, even on a limited-term basis, may pose operational and financial challenges for wind energy operators, particularly in low wind regions. Moreover, operational minimization may not be effective for all species (e.g., bats capable of flying at higher wind speeds). Thus, there is a need to develop alternative solutions that reduce bat fatalities while allowing turbines to operate normally.

IdentiFlight, developed by RES in collaboration with Boulder Imaging, is an autonomous aerial monitoring and detection system. High-precision optical technology installed atop an IdentiFlight tower detects, identifies, and tracks eagles flying within a one-kilometer hemisphere around the IdentiFlight tower. IdentiFlight is intended to facilitate turbine shutdown (also known as ‘informed curtailment’) to reduce collision risk of golden eagles and other protected species. IdentiFlight uses two camera types and a classification algorithm based on machine vision learning. Once an object is detected, IdentiFlight directs a camera to point at the object to determine distance to the object and to gather data to determine if the object is an eagle or not. Video footage is reviewed by technicians and avian experts who then update IdentiFlight’s image library, and this library is used to improve IdentiFlight’s classification algorithms. The position of any bird being tracked is transmitted to a central user interface along with the classification confidence statistic. At the user interface, the bird proximity to a turbine, velocity vector, classification result, and more will be used to activate specific curtailment strategies through signals to turbine operators or automated curtailment of turbines through Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).
The American Wind Wildlife Institute (AWWI) is conducting an independent, 3rd-party evaluation of IdentiFlight’s ability to detect large birds, correctly classify them as eagles or non-eagles, and make curtailment decisions at wind facilities. The results of this multi-year, multi-site evaluation of IdentiFlight’s performance will provide a credible estimate of the reduction in collision risk to eagles gained through the implementation of IdentiFlight. This study will be used by the wind industry and regulatory agencies to inform the appropriate application of IdentiFlight in Eagle Conservation Plans and other conservation measures to reduce collision risk of target species.

DTBird’s detection system scans its surroundings for large birds but is not designed to classify targets or distinguish between species. In this study, the deterrent system is optimized for targets equivalent in size to an eagle with approximately 2-meter wing span. If the automated detection module locks on to a target and perceives that the target has entered a determined collision risk zone, the deterrence module first emits an audible warning signal. If the surveillance system perceives that the target crosses a second, closer distance threshold, then the deterrence module emits a stronger dissuasion signal intended to encourage the bird to change its flight path and avoid the turbine. Technical specifications for this project are based on the model DTBirdV4D8, with four HD wide-angle cameras located every 90° on the tower of the wind turbine 5-10 meters above the ground, and eight speakers, four located by the cameras and four at 90&deg; on the tower of the wind turbine ~10-20 meters below the nacelle.

Active load mitigation offers a way to control both peak and fatigue inducing loads so as to forestall major failures, preclude costly repairs and service interruptions, and extend the life of wind turbine blades, generator components and the entire turbine system. Mitigation of loads requires some form of adaptation of the turbine to variable conditions (e.g., atmospheric turbulence, wind speed variation, turbine to turbine interaction, tower shadow), and these needs can be addressed through an application of “smart” materials-based devices to provide on blade aerodynamic control. 
A novel actuation system, previously developed for on-blade helicopter rotor control applications, is proposed for use on wind turbines as a means of actively mitigating excessive wind turbine loads. The device uses shape memory alloy (SMA) materials as its prime mover; is compact, low power, and robust; and can be designed as an integral member of a rotor blade or as a separate retrofit device to enhance existing wind turbine installations. Applications include active load control of extended length wind turbine blades, low-speed performance improvement on existing and new blade systems, and improved blade endurance and fatigue life through reduction of vibratory loads from atmospheric and upwind wind turbine turbulence.

This requires mapping project finance related uncertainty to identify the major pre-construction risks for investors. PRUF encompasses a wide range of risk reduction activities including performance benchmarking, quantification of performance variability, and operations research. The scope of PRUF includes providing support to related industry working groups, such as the Power Curve Working Group and the Consortium for Advancement of Remote Sensing to help identify the best pathways to reduce uncertainty associated with power curves and resource measurements. The primary focus area of PRUF is the Wind Plant Performance Prediction (WP3) Benchmarking activity, which is a first of its kind data sharing and analysis initiative between major wind industry stakeholders.
The WP3 task can have a significant positive near term impact on wind deployment and LCOE—lessons learned through WP3 can rapidly find their way into industry standards and practices, given the close working relationship between project stakeholders. WP3 aggregates energy yield predictions from consultants and provides critical feedback on the accuracy and uncertainty of those predictions. This facilitates greater investor confidence in the predicted outcomes, and therefore reduces risk premiums associated with wind project investment. Because the PRUF team works closely with industry leading consultants to identify modeling deficiencies, WP3 is able to accelerate the adoption of new methods for estimating energy production. There are three project objectives for the benchmark effort that will accomplish the above outcomes:
<ul> 
<li> Generate accurate, independent benchmarks of current pre-construction energy assessment accuracy;</li> <li> Improve accuracy and reduce uncertainty in pre-construction energy estimates; and,</li>
<li>Create an open knowledge sharing platform that provides state-of-the-art methods and models for pre-construction and operational energy assessments.</li>

This understanding could lead to improved energy capture and reduced blade loading and to a better understanding of wake development and propagation that promises to increase the overall production of a wind plant. Unsteady pressure measurements on the surface of the blades of an industrial-scale wind turbine operating in the field would greatly aid in this process. Due to the harsh environments in which wind turbines operate as well as the difficulties inherent in servicing and accessing the blades, a limited number of pressure measurements on full-scale turbines have been conducted. Whereas prior efforts developed pressure measurement systems as part of a larger campaign, this effort specifically focuses on the challenges of unsteady pressure measurements on a wind turbine blade.
It is anticipated that a measurement system specifically tailored to the field environment that addresses its inherent challenges can be designed and manufactured thus allowing easier implementation. Resono Pressure Systems aims to design and manufacture a pressure measurement system capable of being installed on a wind turbine. First, the project will demonstrate a system in the laboratory, which will allow unsteady pressure measurements and will provide the ancillary systems that increase measurement accuracy for extended time periods. There will be a focus on a robust, self-contained system that is capable of long-term operations on a wind turbine blade in a field environment. A user-friendly graphical interface, communication systems, and software for post-processing the raw pressure measurement data will also be developed. Phase 2 would focus on deploying this system on an operational wind turbine to demonstrate its capabilities and to identify any issues that remain to be addressed. Development of a robust pressure measurement system that can be successfully operated in the harsh wind turbine environment would translate to other environmentally and operationally difficult applications. In particular, applications such as environmental wind tunnel testing, helicopter research, flight testing and gas turbine research could utilize such a system to advance the quality of experimental measurements in their respective fields. In addition, improvement in the models used to design wind turbines and wind plants would be possible using the data generated by the proposed system to validate the models, thereby leading to improved predictive capability.

,Enabling Autonomous Wind Plants through Consensus Control (TCF),National Renewable Energy Laboratory,Atmosphere to electrons: Plant Optimization and Resource Characterization,"$250,000 ",National Laboratory,Annual Operating Plan,CO,Technology Commercialization Fund,/node/4271612,2019,/node/904576,"Turbines within a wind plant typically operate individually to maximize their own performance without explicitly taking into account information from nearby turbines. Enabling cooperation among turbines to achieve plant-level objectives will allow turbines to use information from other turbines nearby to optimize performance, ensure resiliency when sensors fail, and adapt to changing local conditions. A key element of achieving a more efficient wind plant is to develop and validate algorithms that implement the sharing and fusion of information in a way that is reliable, robust, and can run in real-time for the efficient operation of wind turbines in a wind plant. Such algorithms can use local sensor information that is already being collected, such as supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, local meteorological stations, and nearby radars/sodars/lidars, in a coordinated way to improve overall operation. 
In this Technology Commercialization Fund project, NREL is working with RES Group to deploy the Collective Consensus Controller for Performance Optimization (C3PO) on a wind plant in the field to demonstrate the potential  power performance gain in wind plants.
Phase 1: Analysis: Provide an analysis of several wind farms across RES’s portfolio to characterize and better understand the benefits and robustness of NREL’s C3PO across different wind farm layouts/sizes, terrain, turbine manufacturers.    
Phase 2: Planning: Determine the additional hardware/software necessary to implement C3PO in an existing wind farm.  
Phase 3: Demonstration: Implement C3PO on a subset of turbines in existing wind farm and collect data to quantify the benefits of a utility-scale wind farm pilot project.    ",,,
,Wind Turbine Drivetrain Reliability Assessment and Remaining Useful Life Prediction (TCF),National Renewable Energy Laboratory,Next-Generation Technology Development and Manufacturing,"$100,000 ",National Laboratory,Annual Operating Plan,"CO, MA",Technology Commercialization Fund,/node/4271612,2019,/node/778391,"Due to high O&M cost (up to 30% for offshore wind plants), the wind industry is particularly interested in using turbine prognostics or reliability predictions to answer questions regarding how much remaining useful life (RUL) a turbine and its components have once a fault is detected, and what operational conditions or design shortcomings are causing these components to fail. By doing so, wind plant operators and turbine designers could effectively reduce levelized cost of electricity by optimizing O&M practices, enhancing design, and even augmenting controllers to mitigate damages. There are a few commercial reliability assessment and RUL prediction solution providers, which mainly target classical failure modes, such as bearing rolling contact fatigue, that are not prevalent in the field. Importantly, these commercial packages cannot provide a physical understanding of the leading causes and operational events that have caused reliability issues in the first place. By targeting the most dominant and non-classical gearbox failure mode seen in the field, gearbox bearing axial cracking, NREL has developed reliability assessment and RUL prediction software that uses a physics-domain methodology for gearbox reliability assessment, real-time health monitoring, and RUL predictions. 
The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) software has successfully identified high-risk operational events for gearbox high speed stage bearing axial cracking failures and can predict future failures months earlier than classical vibration-based methods. Moreover, NREL’s tool fills a gap that the industry has long needed in evaluating the impacts of both normal turbine operations and transient events on turbine component reliability. However, to make the NREL technology widely useful and most beneficial to the wind industry, further validation and maturation of the software are essential. In this Technology Commercialization Fund project, NREL will work with WindESCo, a startup with a dedicated mission to help wind plant owners and operators and the broad industry enhance performance, O&M and lower cost through innovative solutions. WindESCo will provide the needed data to NREL for such technology validation and maturation, and may choose to acquire NREL’s RUL software under an appropriate license, for integration into their commercial solutions for wind industry customers. The validated solutions can be accessed either directly through WindESCo or by licensing with both parties.",,,
,Fusion Joining of Thermoplastic Composites Using Energy Efficient Processes (TCF),National Renewable Energy Laboratory,Next-Generation Technology Development and Manufacturing,"$150,000 ",National Laboratory,Annual Operating Plan,"CO, NY",Technology Commercialization Fund,/node/4271612,2019,/node/778431,"Wind turbine blades are commonly manufactured using thermoset-resin composites in several key components and bonded together with an adhesive. This includes bonding the high- and low- pressure skins at the leading and trailing edge, as well as bonding the shear web and spar caps. Over the life span of a wind turbine, the blades are exposed to structural loads in varying environmental conditions which can lead to cracking and debonding of the adhesive joints, leading to blade structural collapse. Two-part acrylic-based thermoplastic resins can be used as a drop-in replacement for thermoset resins and can be fusion joined (bonded or welded). This Technology Commercialization Fund project led by NREL with GE Global Rsearch will explore the use of fusion joining of thermoplastic wind turbine blades, eliminating the need for adhesives between blade components which could result in stronger and more reliable blades. The use of adhesives to bond wind turbine blades is also a time-consuming manufacturing process. Blade bonding time could be significantly reduced using fusion joining, leading to reduced manufacturing costs. Furthermore, significant weight reductions could be achieved using fusion joining instead of adding heavy adhesives to the blade bond line. Fusion welding can also facilitate blades being manufactured and joined on-site, reducing transportation size limitations and enabling longer blades for increased energy capture. Commercialization of this technology has the potential to result in stronger, less expensive, and longer wind turbine blades, decreasing the levelized cost of electricity and increasing blade reliability, which is critical to advancing the wind energy market.",,,
