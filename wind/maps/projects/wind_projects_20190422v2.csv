Installed where people live and work, distributed wind systems produce electricity to be consumed locally at homes, schools, farms, businesses, and many other locations. This is different than large wind power projects that generate energy sent via transmission lines to substations for subsequent distribution to loads. Until recently, the distributed wind market per this definition was not analyzed, so making year-to-year comparisons, measuring growth, and identifying trends in the industry were difficult. The annual Distributed Wind Market Report and related products document, analyze, and characterize the differences and trends unique to distributed wind applications, including but not limited to, costs, number of deployments, performance and capacity factors, types of turbines used, application type, domestic and international markets, market drivers and barriers, and local economic impact. Other market reports concentrate only on U.S. wind projects using turbines greater than 100 kW. This report specifically analyzes the distributed wind sector of the market and details the annual U.S. small wind market.

Many of the forecast errors made by regional models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF), resulted from errors in approximations (or parameterizations) of physical processes that were too small or brief to be resolved by the model. Because there are many such approximations in all atmospheric models, it was generally difficult to identify which ones were the largest contributors to model uncertainty. Alternatively, it was possible that there were systematic shortcomings in the parameterizations themselves—such as implicit assumptions related to the complexity of the terrain. The method of uncertainty quantification (UQ) was used to systematically quantify the sensitivities of the wind outputs of interest (e.g., speed, direction, shear, wind power, temperature, and surface fluxes of heat and moisture) to various input parameters.",Completed,will.shaw@pnnl.gov,http://wind.pnnl.gov/uncertaintyquantification.asp

The IFT&E program, co-led by MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT LL) and Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), was established to conduct a series of flight tests with three goals: 
<ul>
<li>Characterize the impact of wind turbines on existing air surveillance radars.</li>
<li>Assess near-term mitigation capabilities proposed by industry.</li>
<li>Collect data and increase technical understanding of interference issues to advance development of long-term mitigation strategies.</li>
</ul>
Test results from the IFT&E program showed that primary surveillance radars were significantly impacted by operating wind turbines at both the detection and tracking levels for regions near and above the wind turbines. For many of the existing air traffic control and air surveillance primary radars, the impacted region includes all altitudes above wind turbines within the coverage volume of the radar. The project purpose is aligned with the three themes outlined in DOE’s recently published Federal Interagency Wind Turbine Radar Interference Mitigation Strategy:  
<ul>
<li>Improving the capacity of government and industry to evaluate the impacts of existing and planned wind energy installations on sensitive radar systems.</li>
<li>Developing and facilitating the deployment of mitigation solutions to increase the resilience of existing radar systems to wind turbines.</li>
<li>Encouraging the development of next-generation radar systems to be resistant to wind turbine interference.</li>
</ul>
The project includes tasks that help improve modeling and simulation tools to aid in the siting and evaluation of planned wind facilities and assessment of potential mitigation measures, to facilitate the rapid deployment of current off-the-shelf mitigation measures such as those evaluated in the IFT&E program, and to help improve the capacity of existing automation and command and control systems to mitigate wind turbine interference impacts to radars.

O&M costs represent approximately 30% of wind LCOE, with maintenance comprising roughly half of that, and large component failures responsible for the majority of maintenance costs. Blades, for example, are designed for a 20-year life while blade replacements affect approximately 1-3% of the fleet per year, and typically cost $200,000 to $300,000 per replacement. The cost of these replacements is spread out over OEMs, owner-operators, and insurance companies, affecting all major components of LCOE. Furthermore, the causes are varied and range from design and manufacturing errors, to transportation and installation damage, to operational damage. The cost of these failures can be only be alleviated by prevention or repair. With a “safe life” design philosophy, components are designed to a certain lifetime based on assumptions about the strength of materials, the quality of the manufacturing process, and the environment that the components will operate in. With a “durability and damage tolerant” design philosophy, effects of defects and damage, inspection technology, repair techniques, and operating environments are known and tightly coupled, such that the current state of the component is continually evaluated. Moving from safe-life to durability-and-damage-tolerant in wind will result in lower cost and cost uncertainty by focusing maintenance effort where and when it is needed, and avoiding large-scale failures, as it has in commercial aerospace. Additionally, the wind industry will soon be facing a large life-extension problem as plants near their original design life. This problem is similar to what commercial aviation faced several decades ago and will likely need this new philosophy to operate turbines reliably and safely for 10 or more additional years. To accomplish this goal, the industry will need to have a validated repertoire of inspection, analysis, and database tools to enable industry participants with the ability to be proactive rather than reactive to address the problems of wind turbine blades with defects.

In 2015, DOE and DOI began developing a new offshore wind strategy aimed at creating an update to the 2011 plan, but based largely on DOE’s 2015 Wind Vision. DOE requested that the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) help develop the new strategy, to be released in 2016, by engaging stakeholders in the U.S. offshore wind industry, providing supporting analysis, and working with the DOE strategy team to develop the final strategy document. This activity is part of DOE’s fundamental mission to support the industry by communicating accurate information and analysis about the technology and economic potential of the emerging offshore wind industry.
A general framework for the new 2016 U.S. offshore wind strategy was provided by the 2015 Wind Vision, which prescribed 86 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy by 2050. However, the Wind Vision was written at a high level and did not provide the details to be translated directly into an actionable strategy for the DOE program, and did not establish a high-resolution baseline for cost, value, or economic potential. Under this activity, NREL provided direct support to DOE and DOI’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management by conducting analysis to support the updated offshore wind strategy. This analysis incorporated NREL’s unique capabilities and expertise in offshore wind resource assessment and economic and market analysis to help DOE assess the current situation in offshore wind and chart a course for the next 5 years. NREL also updated existing data and developed new information that will help the creation and maturation of an offshore sector to the wind industry as described in the Wind Vision. The overall project objectives were to Support the development of a new offshore wind strategy in the context of the Wind Vision and to provide analysis and information to the offshore wind strategy team.

Representing a meaningful portion of the wind turbine investment, few other components have such a direct impact on the energy capture, loads management, and availability of the wind turbine system. Compromising any of these factors is not an option for a world-class wind turbine OEM. Wind turbine blade manufacturing is well suited to the infusion process, due to the relatively simple geometries of the blade shells. There are still challenges due to the size of the shell components, resulting in expensive molds which contribute a significant portion of the overall blade cost. The highest cost asset of the whole process is the shell mold, which is used to make the skins of the blade through the resin infusion process.

In this project, Argonne conducted a detailed assessment of how stochastic approaches can be used at different stages in system and market operations, from day-ahead scheduling to real-time dispatch. The Argonne team first conducted a review of existing work and summarized the main results from previous studies while also identifying the main impediments for introducing stochastic methods into operational decisions making. Next, the team developed a systematic set of metrics and a consistent framework to evaluate different scheduling, dispatch, and market operations strategies. They also conducted an initial quantitative evaluation of the potential benefits of stochastic programming approaches compared to traditional deterministic models and other alternatives. 
The case study was conducted on a hypothetical test system, considering a number of realistic constraints and operational procedures. The results of this project provided the electric power industry with better insights into the range of different stochastic methods that can be applied to power system operations, the potential benefits of shifting towards stochastic methods in operations, and also to better appreciate likely challenges, from technical, market, and computational perspectives. 
Overall, the project has expanded the industry’s understanding of potential methods and tools available to address the uncertainty and variability in wind power and other renewable resources, thereby facilitating a more cost effective integration of wind power into the grid. More specifically, the objectives of the project were to: 
<ul>
<li>Classify existing approaches and tools for stochastic grid operations under uncertainty in renewable generation.</li>
<li>Identify the most promising application areas for stochastic approaches in grid operations, considering cost, reliability, market implementation, and computational perspectives.</li>
<li>Identify the main impediments for introducing stochastic methods, considering system operators, utilities, as well as operational software vendors.</li>

Although there is no power transmission link between the NWTC and ESIF, the operational data from the NWTC generation can be “connected” to ESIF via a virtual data link for conducting various combined experiments using the real-time power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) capabilities of the ESIF. This link enables ESIF’s access to real multimegawatt variable generation. The generation of wind and solar photovoltaics along with the existing 7-MVA and two multimegawatt-scale dynamometers creates a unique environment for testing and demonstration of many grid integration aspects of renewable generation, energy storage, protection equipment, advanced controls, and energy management systems. In addition, a new multimegawatt energy storage testing facility at the NWTC can be coupled with the existing variable generation and/or CGI. Connecting both the ESIF and CGI into a combined test bed has increased the value of both facilities, and creates a unique capability for advanced PHIL multimegawatt testing to address challenges of large-scale integration of renewable energy sources in the energy system infrastructure. An important aspect of carrying out combined PHIL experiments utilizing real-time models of various power systems is the ability of NWTC generation to activate certain grid-friendly controls and/or operate on set points generated by ESIF-CGI real-time power system models. For this purpose, appropriate communications capabilities were added to the supervisory control and data acquisition systems of the existing NWTC generation.

In many areas throughout the world, wind power is supplying up to 20% of total energy demand. In the United States, balancing areas like the Public Service of Colorado have occasions where over 50% of the hourly demand is supplied by wind power. Wind power, particularly variable-speed wind power, which is the majority of all wind plant capacity in the world, is also different from conventional thermal and hydropower-generating technologies as it is not synchronized to the electrical frequency of the power grid and is generally unresponsive to system frequency. The focus of this project is a mitigation strategy that is not often discussed and is in some ways counterintuitive: the use of wind power to support power system reliability by providing active power control (APC) at fast timescales. APC is the adjustment of a resource’s active power in various response timeframes to assist in balancing the generation and load, thereby improving power system reliability. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), along with partners from the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the University of Colorado and collaboration from a large international industry stakeholder group, embarked on a comprehensive study to understand the ways in which wind power technology can assist the power system by providing control of its active power output being injected onto the grid. The study includes a number of different power system simulations, control simulations, and actual field tests using turbines at NREL’s National Wind Technology Center (NWTC). The study sought to understand how wind power providing APC can benefit numerous parties by reducing total production costs, increasing wind power revenue streams, improving the reliability and security of the power system, and providing superior and efficient response, while limiting any structural and loading impacts that may shorten the life of the wind turbine or its components.",Active,brian.smith@nrel.gov,https://www.nrel.gov/wind/

The WfS project addresses and supports the need for 600,000 skilled jobs to support the U.S. wind industry.
 WfS is somewhat unique in its educational approach, by working with partners like KidWind Project, the National Energy Education Development Project (NEED) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to provide an educational focus that is heavy on hands-on learning. Additionally, wind energy curricula supported through teacher training workshops in 12 states are coordinated across a wide age group (elementary school through university levels). Currently, WfS is working in 12 states, with educational activities managed at the University level. Twelve university (undergraduate and graduate) wind energy programs, identified as Wind Application Centers, were initiated by the WfS project, and several hundred students have graduated with active involvement in the Wind Application Centers by  deploying small wind energy systems, conducting wind-related research, attending a wind energy class, or engaging in educational outreach activities. 
At the beginning of 2017, there are 147 Wind for Schools turbines across the country providing hands-on learning opportunities to thousands of students at public K-12 schools as well as universities. Each host school brings the wind turbine into their classroom via interactive and interschool research tasks designed around their turbine. These classes and workshops, combined with the passionate teachers that provide the instruction, have inspired students to learn not just about renewable energy, but about science and technology concepts in mechanical, electrical, and aeronautical engineering areas. Additionally, stakeholder engagement and energy project siting issues are  explored. Lastly, through family involvement and other outreach activities, the WfS program has helped to inform the communities that these schools serve about wind energy and general energy project siting concepts. University students are engaged further as they serve as project consultants and mentors for the k-12 host school students. 
The twelve WfS states support Wind Applications Centers at: Renewable Energy Alaska Project (in partnership with the University of Alaska-Fairbanks), Northern Arizona University, Colorado State University, Boise State University, Western Illinois University, Kansas State University, Montana State University, Appalachian State University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Pennsylvania State University, South Dakota State University, and James Madison University.

The work falls into the following general project areas, each with specific objectives: 1) <a href="" https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/10/f37/2016_Wind_Technologies_Market_Report_101317.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Wind Technologies Market Report</a> to help stakeholders stay current by publishing an annual report that provides a detailed overview of wind energy developments, with a key focus on technology, performance, cost and pricing; 2) Wind Energy Costs and Benefits to inform decision-making at the national and local levels by evaluating the costs, benefits, and impacts of wind energy; 3) Wind Policies and Finance to inform decisions related to federal and state policy deployment drivers and related implications for finance; and 4) Technical Assistance to aid state and federal decision-makers, as well as wind and utility stakeholders, on a variety of matters relating to the DOE Wind mission. 
Collectively, this work seeks to inform a diverse array of wind energy and electric sector decision-makers. The empirical wind project cost, performance, pricing, technology, and deployment data analyzed under this project helps the DOE to understand the current market status and future potential of wind power in order to prioritize its R&D investment portfolio to those projects that have the most meaningful impact on lowering the cost and increasing the deployment of wind power. Technology characterization and system cost analysis, including those conducted under IEA Wind Task 26, provide insight into the potential for technology advances to reduce levelized costs. Providing unbiased information about the market and potential for wind energy to industry stakeholders leads to broader participation in the wind energy market. Providing objective analysis of and information on wind energy markets, economics, regulations, and players to the financial industry lowers financial risk by decreasing uncertainty about wind power project and sector performance.

The Wind Vision included detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, and impacts of achieving and sustaining high wind penetrations nationwide (e.g., 20% by 2030, 35% by 2050). While the report relied on extensive expertise and contributions from the Labs, the wind industry, power system operators, academia, AWEA, WEF, and others, the modeling and impacts assessments focused on the prescribed visionary wind levels and did not explore the policy mechanisms to achieve those levels. While NREL’s state-of-the-art ReEDS capacity expansion model was used in the core impacts analysis for the Wind Vision, the study did not include more-detailed production cost simulations to evaluate implications of systems operations of high wind scenarios. The project built from the Wind Vision and addressed open research questions. The project also applied electric sector analysis to support DOE wind strategic planning in relation to the DOE role in achieving the Wind Vision. The project included two core components, one primarily using the ReEDS model and another using PLEXOS. The ReEDs report looked at potential futures of wind energy under various economic and technology improvement scenarios. It found that, while the wind market faces headwinds associated with the expiration of the production tax credit after 2020, continued aggressive cost reductions through investment in research and development can help drive significant continued deployment between now and 2050.

The PLEXOS study, <a href=""http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/67240.pdf"" target=""_blank"">available online</a>, simulated the operation of the grid in the Western Interconnection and confirms that even limited electricity expansion can significantly reduce the costs of achieving a future where wind energy supplies 35% of U.S. electricity by 2050. If a handful of currently proposed transmission projects alone are built, wind curtailment can be reduced by about half (from 15.5% to 7.8%). If limited additional transmission expansion occurs beyond those projects that are currently proposed, wind curtailment in the Wind Vision Study Scenario can be reduced even further, allowing full use of wind energy, reducing generation costs, and enabling further reductions in air pollution emissions.

The turbine can be deployed in water deeper than 35 meters (m) and is expected to deliver a significant reduction in the cost of energy (COE) generated by offshore wind. The cost reduction is achieved by capturing more wind with less material including copper and rare earth magnets. The objective of the project was to increase the fidelity of the simulation model in order to clearly demonstrate the cost of energy estimates by: 
<ul>
<li>Determining the expected energy delivered.</li>
<li>Determining the loads on the components and therefore the required dimensions of the components.</li>
<li>Determining the cost to build the components and the turbine from the dimensions of the components.</li>

The dominant incumbent solutions in the offshore wind (OSW) market currently are the monopile and the jacket. The gravity base is among the existing solutions but has relatively low deployment level compared to the monopile and jacket. These solutions are not cost effective for Icebreaker, a 6 wind turbine generator (WTG) OSW project in Lake Erie, approximately 8 miles off the coast of Cleveland, OH, and by extension, Lake Erie.

Due to the modular design, thicker towers capable of supporting turbines at increased heights (120 meters or 394 feet) can be produced at a reduced cost. The objectives were to: 
<ul>
<li>Design and optimize 120 m (394 ft) and 140 m (459 ft) tall towers and foundations to support 2.3 MW and 3.2 MW turbines. </li>

</ul> 
Several new technologies had been suggested for taller towers, but none of the options had shown to be cost competitive, as evidenced by the limited use and the inability to eliminate transportation and logistics challenges. The Hexcrete technology puts the manufacturer, contractor, and wind farm owners in charge of how the tower should be prefabricated and erected, avoiding any special transportation requirements. It offers versatilities in the use of materials, connection choice, location of prefabrication, erection sequence, and the possibility of combining concrete with steel tubular segments. Using High Performance Concrete (HPC) and Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC), the technology allowed the base dimension to be limited to that expected for steel tubular towers. Tower dimensions were governed by strength requirement, not fatigue loads, allowing the towers to be designed for 40 to 50 years of design life. Since the entire tower is post-tensioned to the foundation using unbonded tendons, it can also be detensioned and disassembled relatively easily, simplifying the decommissioning of the towers.

This technology could reduce operating costs by decreasing unscheduled downtime due to unplanned maintenance. The objective of this project was to develop a low-cost, online, intelligent prognostic health monitoring system (PHMS) for wind turbines. The PHMS primarily uses current signals acquired from generator terminals or in the wind turbine control system to diagnose and prognose the faults and determine the health condition of the wind turbine system. In addition to current signals, the PHMS can also be used to include vibration signals in wind turbines to provide additional prognostic health monitoring capability and improved diagnosis and prognosis accuracy. Due to the fundamental difference between a wind turbine drivetrain and pitch system, different PHMSs were developed for drivetrains and pitch systems. In this project, the PHMSs developed were demonstrated on two types of wind turbine drivetrains. One type of drivetrain consists of a turbine rotor, blades, and an electrical generator, which are commonly used in direct-drive (no gearbox) wind turbines equipped with permanent-magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs). The other type of drivetrain consists of a turbine rotor, blades, a gearbox, and an electrical generator, which are commonly used in wind turbines equipped with doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs).

While radar platforms have been used extensively in meteorological applications, this is the first radar system specifically designed for wind energy research. This new design for a modular and portable system requires less power to operate and can measure larger areas than currently utilized conventional radar systems. The goal of this project was to revolutionize wind farm complex flow measurements. The feasibility of employing radar technology to measure wind plant relevant complex flows (e.g. turbine-to-turbine interaction, and/or turbine inflow and wake flow) was historically illustrated by Texas Tech University using the TTUKa radars. While maintaining unique advantages in resolution, scan speed and maximum range relative to other technologies, the existing TTUKa radars provided limited data availability in many non-precipitating (i.e. clear air) environments, did not operate in an autonomous manner, were susceptible to attenuation in moderate/heavy precipitation, and maintained water vapor and sea salt absorption issues that minimized performance offshore. These inherent limitations reduced the application of the technology to research oriented projects. This incubator project resulted in the development of a new DOE-X prototype radar which maintains similar spatial and temporal resolutions to that of the TTUKa radars, but mitigates the identified limitations leading to the potential for more widespread adoption. 
The new prototype radar will assist DOE and industry partners in developing smart wind farms, where energy extraction and loads mitigation are considered at the plant scale. By providing more reliable complex flow information at sufficient resolution from across an entire wind plant, the new radar technology opens the door for rapid validation of wind plant scale control concepts and related simulations. Given that there is up to a 30% reduction in plant performance due to turbine-to-turbine interaction alone, new optimization concepts at the plant level offer a tremendous opportunity to enhance the output from both new and existing wind plants and significantly lower the cost of energy. 
The developed DOE-X radar provides a cornerstone instrument to assist in this transition. The project complements the Energy Department’s ongoing Atmosphere to Electrons (A2e) Initiative, which aims to improve wind plant performance by increasing understanding of how wind moves throughout wind farms.

The deterrent design consisted of a series of ultrasonic pulse generators, or whistles modeled after that of a bat larynx, which responds in a non-linear fashion to small changes in air pressure, allowing for chaotic changes in frequency of sound produced.  The whistles were affixed to a wind turbine blade to passively produce ultrasonic sounds mimicking the spectrotemporal patterns of bat echolocation pulses as turbine blades spin, thereby enhancing the bats’ ability to detect, localize and avoid the moving blades. Initial prototype design were followed by an iterative process of modelling, three-dimensional fabrication, and testing to ensure performance over a range of conditions. Factors critical to success included reproduction of key features of bat larynx acoustic behavior in a man-made mechanical device, evaluation of acoustic performance through the use of a pressurized air-line and wind tunnel, and evaluation of deterrent properties on bats in the laboratory and field.

Beginning in 2013, GE and California Ridge Wind Energy (CRWE) began testing their pneumatic deterrent device at an operating wind farm in Illinois. For these tests, 20 GE 1.6-100 wind turbines were outfitted with the deterrent device. Based on this independent development outside the scope of the DOE program, the device has been shown to be approximately 30% effective at reducing estimated bat mortality at the wind farm. These experiments indicated that while the device can be successful, additional information on bat behavior in the presence of deterrent noise is needed to refine the device and/or the deployment strategy to increase its effectiveness. The behavioral and farm test research conducted under the DOE project were designed to improve the initial test results of this technology by developing scientific and biological data that could be used to enhance the efficacy of the device and its deployment by exploring factors such as acoustic signal and device placement. The project objectives were to improve the effectiveness of the deterrent device to greater than 50% reduction in bat mortality through behavioral studies that will allow the team to refine the device (amplitude and/or frequency of the acoustic signal) and/or refine the deployment strategy (more devices, strategic placement).

Active load mitigation offers a way to control both peak and fatigue inducing loads so as to forestall major failures, preclude costly repairs and service interruptions, and extend the life of wind turbine blades, generator components and the entire turbine system. Mitigation of loads requires some form of adaptation of the turbine to variable conditions (e.g., atmospheric turbulence, wind speed variation, turbine to turbine interaction, tower shadow), and these needs can be addressed through an application of “smart” materials-based devices to provide on blade aerodynamic control. 
A novel actuation system, previously developed for on-blade helicopter rotor control applications, is proposed for use on wind turbines as a means of actively mitigating excessive wind turbine loads. The device uses shape memory alloy (SMA) materials as its prime mover; is compact, low power, and robust; and can be designed as an integral member of a rotor blade or as a separate retrofit device to enhance existing wind turbine installations. Applications include active load control of extended length wind turbine blades, low-speed performance improvement on existing and new blade systems, and improved blade endurance and fatigue life through reduction of vibratory loads from atmospheric and upwind wind turbine turbulence. 
Phase I of the research program is to understand and address the scaling issues associated with transitioning this technology from helicopter aerospace applications to wind turbine blade design and operational use. Phase II is to execute a design/build/test program to validate the actuation concept’s effectiveness at load reduction, and suggest improvements and modifications necessary to implement these actuators on both future turbine rotors and as a retrofit improvement onto existing rotors on installed turbines.

Coinciding with the industry’s growth, significant technology innovation has resulted in larger turbines with lower associated costs of energy and more complex designs in all subsystems. However, as the deployment of the technology grows, and its role within the electricity sector becomes more prominent, so have the expectations of the technology in terms of performance, reliability, and cost. The industry currently partitions its efforts into separate paths for turbine design, plant design and development, finance, grid interaction and operation, mitigation of adverse community and environmental impacts, and other areas.
One prominent area where this partition is evident is in wind turbine control. Traditionally, each wind turbine in a wind plant has been controlled separately – via its own internal controller using only its own sensors. However, wind turbines in a plant interact with each other through the plant level fluid dynamics. Wake losses (due to upstream turbines extracting energy from the winds and “waking” downstream turbines) can be up to 10% or even 20% of the gross energy production (if each turbine experienced the free stream wind inflow to the plant). A series of studies and experiments have demonstrated that there is potential for improving energy output at existing wind plants through plant control methods which seek to optimize total wind plant energy production over the current approach where each turbine maximizes its own production. Wake steering induced by yaw offsets (turning the turbine to be out of the plane perpendicular to wind inflow) for upstream turbines has shown significant promise in simulations and wind tunnel experiments. In simulation studies, annual energy production has been shown to increase by 2% or more depending on the particular aspects of the wind plant (turbine spacing, meteorological conditions, etc.). This project seeks to demonstrate the potential of plant-level controls via wake steering at a commercial wind plant. This is an important step towards commercialization and industry adoption of this plant-level modeling and analysis capability.",Active,brian.smith@nrel.gov,https://www.nrel.gov/wind/facilities-research.html

The centerpiece of the instrumentation for each buoy is a motion-corrected LIDAR system that can provide profiles of the wind speed and direction from the surface to 200 m. In addition to a LIDAR, each buoy collects ocean temperature, salinity, current, and wave data as well as near-surface air temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction. This project will provide analyses of the data previously collected by the buoys to help fill the current substantial gap in observations characterizing the wind resource in the U.S. offshore environment. These buoys are deployed at DOE’s direction, nominally for a year, in different regions of the United States to collect hub-height offshore wind data in support of the U.S. offshore wind industry. Initial deployments were completed off the coasts of Virginia and New Jersey. These buoys have produced the first publicly-available multi-seasonal hub-height data to be collected in U.S. coastal waters. They consequently provide an important new opportunity to characterize the wind resource using observations in regions targeted for wind development, to evaluate and improve simulation-based maps of the offshore wind resource, to improve the underlying models that are used to generate those maps, and to evaluate the applicability and limitations of basic physical concepts reflected in methodologies such as those used in IEC codes to scale winds from surface measurements to hub height. Over its lifetime this project will analyze data from the buoys to address a variety of technical questions associated with the offshore wind profile. Initial analysis will focus on describing the general performance of the LIDAR systems in the marine environment. In addition, data from the other atmospheric and oceanographic systems on the buoy will be analyzed to establish instrument performance and the general ocean and atmospheric conditions during the periods of deployment. Subsequent analyses will evaluate the impacts on the wind profile of evolving atmospheric and sea state conditions, including the behavior of classical wind profile functions in these environments.

It follows that wind’s LCOE can, therefore, be lowered simply by reducing performance risk and uncertainty in ways that flow through to improvements in these three financing terms. But what is the size of the overall opportunity to reduce wind’s LCOE solely through performance risk reduction? Where do the most effective opportunities for targeted risk reduction lie?

Finally, Aquanis will conduct, large-scale, high voltage experimental lightning testing to demonstrate the benefits of static charge reduction and manipulating lightning attachment processes on a realistic blade shape. The implementation of the proposed surface coating will help minimize lightning damage to wind turbines, an area of concern and cost for wind farm owners and operators. Better lightning protection systems help reduce the cost of wind energy by reducing O&M expenses and minimizing turbine downtime, project risk, and costly insurance claims.

The advanced manufacturing method reduces the capital cost of an offshore substructure and tower compared to conventional methods by up to 80% using low-cost regionally sourced concrete without expensive formwork, and increases production speed up to 20 times using an automated production-line approach. The initial target application of the additive manufacturing process is a 160-m tall gravity-based foundation and concrete tower for an offshore 10-MW turbine installed in 40-m of water.",Active,,
STTR1.3,Unsteady Surface Pressure Measurement System Suitable for Making Measurements on Wind Turbine Blades in the Field,Resono Pressure Systems LLC,Atmosphere to electrons: Plant Optimization and Resource Characterization,"$150,000 ",Private Industry,Competitive Funding Opportunity Announcement,WY,"Small Technology Transfer Phase I, Release 2",,2018,/node/778436,"Increased productivity of wind turbines and wind plants requires a better understanding of the unsteady blade aerodynamics. This understanding could lead to improved energy capture and reduced blade loading and to a better understanding of wake development and propagation that promises to increase the overall production of a wind plant. Unsteady pressure measurements on the surface of the blades of an industrial-scale wind turbine operating in the field would greatly aid in this process. Due to the harsh environments in which wind turbines operate as well as the difficulties inherent in servicing and accessing the blades, a limited number of pressure measurements on full-scale turbines have been conducted. Whereas prior efforts developed pressure measurement systems as part of a larger campaign, this effort specifically focuses on the challenges of unsteady pressure measurements on a wind turbine blade.
It is anticipated that a measurement system specifically tailored to the field environment that addresses its inherent challenges can be designed and manufactured thus allowing easier implementation. Resono Pressure Systems aims to design and manufacture a pressure measurement system capable of being installed on a wind turbine. First, the project will demonstrate a system in the laboratory, which will allow unsteady pressure measurements and will provide the ancillary systems that increase measurement accuracy for extended time periods. There will be a focus on a robust, self-contained system that is capable of long-term operations on a wind turbine blade in a field environment. A user-friendly graphical interface, communication systems, and software for post-processing the raw pressure measurement data will also be developed. Phase 2 would focus on deploying this system on an operational wind turbine to demonstrate its capabilities and to identify any issues that remain to be addressed. Development of a robust pressure measurement system that can be successfully operated in the harsh wind turbine environment would translate to other environmentally and operationally difficult applications. In particular, applications such as environmental wind tunnel testing, helicopter research, flight testing and gas turbine research could utilize such a system to advance the quality of experimental measurements in their respective fields. In addition, improvement in the models used to design wind turbines and wind plants would be possible using the data generated by the proposed system to validate the models, thereby leading to improved predictive capability.

Larger rotors capture substantially more energy both through a greater swept area and accessing increased wind speeds at higher above ground levels. Another impact of this rotor growth has been higher capacity factor wind plants, yielding less variability in power production. With limited high wind resource sites, future development will depend in part on deployment in lower wind resource sites, requiring further increases in rotor size for cost-effective energy production. However, the technologies required to enable the next generation of rotors have not been validated, including large blade manufacturing and transportation, rotor controls, and advanced blade materials and structural concepts. In addition, numerous fundamental scientific questions and challenges remain to be solved. A multi-lab team of SNL, NREL, ORNL, and LBNL are engaged in a five-year integrated research program to develop technology that will drive down the cost of wind energy through a 10% increase in capacity factor. The project will begin with background research studies on existing trends in the wind industry for low specific power turbines, and the value that these machines would provide in projected future energy markets. A key design target for this effort is a 10% increase in capacity factor over current technology, enabled by a reduction in specific power to at least 150 W/m2 at an IEC Class II wind site. Researchers will create a matrix of potential innovative concepts, seek feedback from leading wind technology experts, and analyze concepts with a system-level techno-economic model. The most promising concepts will be selected and critical components validated, culminating in a field demonstration of a viable ultra-low-specific wind power rotor design.
