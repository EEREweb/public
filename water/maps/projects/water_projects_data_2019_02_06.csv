Over the past six years, RE Vision Consulting has developed a suite of parametrically driven techno-economic models that were used in a wide range of siting and economic studies. The study addressed three major questions: (1) what is the present cost of MHK technologies, (2) how much energy can be extracted from these MHK resources at what cost, and (3) at which cost levels will the technology see significant deployment in the United States? To address these questions, RE Vision Consulting engaged in three sequential efforts: (1) establishment of present-day cost profiles for MHK technologies, (2) compilation of existing resource assessments to develop supply curves, and
(3) development of deployment scenarios to evaluate how much present-day costs would need to be reduced to allow for significant technology deployment in the United States. The project's results support a more accurate understanding of the present and future life-cycle cost for emerging MHK generation technologies.

The objective of the feasibility study is to evaluate the potential environmental impacts associated with sediment transport alteration of two established tidal energy technologies, as well as to collect and analyze information on the occurrence and potential impacts of protected species in the project area. The research will generate information useful to the water power industry on the differences between the two tidal energy technologies relationship to sediment transport alteration, as well as information of broader public interest on the existence of protected marine species in the project area that will be raised during  the  permitting  process.

The mussels have spread to a majority of the large rivers of the United States and impact many of the hydropower projects in those watersheds. Left uncontrolled, fouling by zebra and/or quagga mussels may disrupt operation, impede water flow significantly, and diminish the power output of hydroelectric dams. Existing commercial anti-fouling paints that are used as coatings are inappropriate for hydropower applications either because they are toxic and leak poisons into the water or have proven largely ineffective against preventing mussel colonization. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is working to mature and demonstrate durable, economical, and nontoxic coatings that will prevent invasive mussels from growing on hydropower structures. A novel, foul-release coating recently developed at PNNL, Superhydrophobic Lubricant Infused Composite (SLIC) technology, will be adapted to provide the durability necessary for over five years of protection in the freshwater environment. The chemical and physical properties of this &lsquo;slippery,&lsquo; foul-release surface coating prevents organisms from attaching and will be optimized for the fresh water conditions common to hydropower operations. This coating is based on a substance found in nature that carnivorous pitcher plants excrete to trap insect prey.

Cavitation is a phenomenon that affects hydropower turbines when, under certain operation conditions, vapor bubbles form and collapse due to rapid pressure changes in the water as it moves through the turbine. When the vapor bubbles collapse, they generate shock waves that create pits on the metal surface. Damages caused by cavitation include erosion of material from turbine parts, distortion of blade angle, and loss of efficiency due to erosion/distortion. Cavitation damage is usually the most costly maintenance activity on a hydropower turbine because of the unexpected shutdowns and unplanned maintenance required for repairs.",Active,,Hydropower,,/node/3928235

In addition, they can withstand the rigors of severe load variation    and lubricant contamination. A hydrokinetic energy machine with water-lubricated PCD bearings would reduce maintenance costs and improve reliability over equivalent machines using conventional bearings. In addition, PCD bearings without lubricants other than the water itself reduce the danger of polluting a marine environment. This project used advanced analytical tools for the initial design of thrust bearings for use in a conceptual water turbine; built and tested the bearings in the US Synthetic bearing test facility; and compared the measured bearing performance with the design predictions.

,Annual Operating Plan,,,2018,"Wave Energy Converter Interlink Umbilical Cables: Design Requirements, Best Practices, and Recommended Design Improvements",National Renewable Energy Laboratory,Laboratory,MHK Research and Development,,,,CO,Mountain,West,"$400,000 ","Conventional marine umbilical designs for offshore oil and gas and offshore wind often do not meet the design and cost needs of wave energy technologies. Unique wave energy requirements include the ability to handle significantly larger motions and loads over longer deployments than typical cable applications. As a result, poorly designed umbilicals can fail early and/or increase project costs. Premature umbilical failure can be catastrophic because umbilicals are critical to delivering power and are difficult and expensive to swap out. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in partnership with offshore cable experts Delmar Systems Inc. (Delmar) and the University of Southampton, are working to accelerate the development and reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of commercial wave energy systems by empowering the design and utilization of robust and cost-effective medium voltage power and communication umbilicals that connect floating wave energy converters (WECs) to subsea transmission lines. This one-year project will utilize accepted industry practices from offshore wind and oil & gas and existing software tools (WEC-Sim and OrcaFlex) to evaluate the lifecycle mechanical and electrical performance of interlink umbilicals, define expected requirements, and make suggested improvements based on a techno-economic evaluation.",Active,,MHK,,/node/3996714

WaveConnect was conceived as a multi-stage process leading to long-term megawatt-scale wave power production. The program was halted near the end of the first stage for the following reasons: (1) permitting issues were much more challenging than originally anticipated; and (2) the cost of developing a pilot project was much greater than the $15 - $20 million originally estimated. Significant additional investment in design, testing, and demonstration will be needed to improve designs and reduce costs. PG&E estimated a cost of electricity that is not competitive with current or near-term renewable alternatives, such as wind or solar photovoltaics.

Most wave energy converters can only achieve a nameplate capacity of less than 1 megawatt due to physical limitations driven by metocean conditions. This leads to high structural costs and low power production, with mooring   and installation encompassing 25% - 40% of the device's capital cost. The project assessed a combination of a number of wave and wind energy power take-off mechanisms in an innovative floating support structure, the WindFloat, thus amortizing the mooring and installation costs over higher power output. The use of a floating support structure leads to a number of additional benefits, like reduced environmental impacts and more flexible siting in  deep waters. The project consisted of engineering studies, numerical and physical models development, wave tank validation and testing, performance verification, cost/benefit analysis, and optimization studies to increase energy production.
