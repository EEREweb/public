72,Module Quality and Safety,<p>This section provides guidance on how agencies can procure high-quality and durable PV modules that are designed and manufactured to last the full contract period.</p>,"<p>There are three common ways to screen modules for quality:</p>

<p><strong>Method 1: Minimum accelerated test standards:</strong></p>
<p>Request that Contractors provide during the submittal phase the results of the following minimum accelerated tests:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Thermal Cycling (as per IEC 61215:2016) x 600 cycles
</li><li>Damp Heat (as per IEC 61215:2016) x 2,000 hours
</li><li>Dynamic Mechanical Load (as per IEC TS 62782:2016) x 1,000 cycles + Thermal Cycling (as per IEC 61215:2016) x 50 cycles + Humidity Freeze (as per IEC 61215:2016) x 10 cycles
</li><li>Potential Induced Degradation (as per IEC 63204) x 192 hours
</li><li>Third-party PAN file measurements (as per IEC 61853-1)
</li><li>Incident Angle Modifier (IAM) coefficients (as per IEC 61853-2)
</li><li>Light Induced Degradation (as per IEC 61215:2016) and Light and Elevated Temperature Induced Degradation testing (as per draft IEC 61215)
</li>
</ul>
<p>The modules delivered to the project site must have the same bill of materials (BOM) as tested.</p>
 
<p><strong>Method 2: Existing test lab results made public:</strong></p>
<p>Some certified test labs share results publicly under pre-negotiated agreements with module manufacturers.  These public lists of tested modules are not comprehensive but do provide a very convenient source of information on brands that have been tests. </p>

<p>One public source is the annual test results published by PV Evolution Labs (PVEL): <a href=""https://www.pvel.com/pv-scorecard/"">https://www.pvel.com/pv-scorecard/</a></p>
 
<p><strong>Method 3: For large multi-megawatt projects:</strong></p>
<p>For very large utility scale projects (several megawatts in size), customers can request testing of a statistically meaningful group of modules from the same batch slated to be shipped to the project site. Specialized third-party consulting firms perform this service for industry stakeholders and do on-the-spot inspections of manufacturing facilities to verify quality programs.</p>","<p>Failures with most solar PV system components are easily addressed and represent only short-term loss of power output and inconvenience. However, if modules fail in large numbers, this is a serious economic and life safety issue for both the Contractor and the host agency. Large numbers of module failures represent potential total loss of savings, life-safety hazards, property damage, and time-consuming and embarrassing circumstances.  If the agency site is located in a high fire-prone area, then module quality should be an imperative.
 </p><p>
Since safety, long-term quality, and performance are intrinsically linked, only modules passing independent test lab accelerated testing may be used. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Qualification Plus (<a href=""https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60950.pdf"">https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/60950.pdf</a>) testing guidelines provide details on the minimum testing conditions. 
</p><p>
Alternatively, some certified test labs have expanded/extended test standards based on the Qualification Plus (QP) testing regime and provide important testing services to module manufacturers and system owners.  The QP program represents what should be included in a minimum testing regime by any certified lab.  One test lab, PVEL, has made its test results available in an annual report called the PVEL-2019 PV Module Reliability Scorecard report.  This report provides an easy way to find tested and scored modules, however, it is only updated annually and does not cover many manufacturers and model numbers on the market.   
</p><p>
The primary existing design qualification standards International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215 (crystalline cells) and IEC 61646 (thin film) have been successful in preventing initial early life module failures but are insufficient in predicting failure modes seen in the field over time.  A set of accelerated tests have been developed and refined that are adequate for predicting module longevity.

The Contractor must determine that the structure of the building is not compromised. The structural analysis study shall include, but not be limited to, the weight of the PV system itself, seismic loads, and water, snow, and ice ponding. If the roof has existing water ponding issues, the addition of arrays shall not substantially worsen ponding conditions. Existing ponding conditions shall be considered a possible indication of an underlying structural issue needing special attention by structural engineer. 
</p><p>
The structural analysis study shall include considerations of concentrated loads as equipment is staged prior to or during the installation of the PV system.  It is ultimately the Contractor's responsibility to perform its own field investigations and determination of system design.

101,Ballasted Arrays,<p>This section describes limitations on the use of self-ballasted arrays.</p>,"<p>Self-ballasted or partially self-ballasted arrays are permissible:</p>
<ul><li>On buildings structurally capable of carrying loads.
</li><li>In cases where maximum annual winds are less than 70 MPH. Fully ballasted systems are not permissible in any region experiencing high winds in excess of 70 MPH.
</li><li>In cases with moderate wind loading less than 70 MPH, some mechanical attachments shall be engineered and deployed to prevent loss; see the hybrid approach. </li></ul>","<p>TAKE NOTE!  There have been high wind incidents causing self-ballasted roof arrays to dislodge from mounting locations, scattering debris.  Due to the severe life-safety hazards of array debris striking pedestrians below a roof,  it is recommended that engineers closely track this facet of array engineering. 
</p><p>
There are several reasons why self-ballasted roof arrays are desirable; however, there are often building conditions which can limit the use of ballasting. Self-ballasted systems obviously keep penetrations through roofing systems to a minimum, which in turn reduces potential leak points and maintenance costs. Also very important with ballasted systems is minimizing anchoring through roofing and insulation materials to the building frame. Connecting to a building frame can cause serious thermal bridging, which in turn reduces the building's performance.
</p><p>
Due to structural limitations, the full amount of ballasting may need to be reduced for a given facility. There are strategies and hardware that can be used to reduce the need for ballasting, such as use of cabling strung through an array that is anchored at the perimeter. Some vendors offer interlocking systems that make arrays strong as a whole, which reduces the need for ballasting and roof penetrations.</p>",Minimum,Specifications,Array Type: Roof Mount,,Engineering; Safety,,All
103,Hybrid Approach,<p>This section describes when a hybrid approach of using both anchored and ballasted methods is applicable.</p>,"<p>If the building structure cannot support the full amount of an array ballast, the Contractor shall propose a partially ballasted system that uses minimum roof penetrations. If the building structure cannot support any array ballast, and where high wind speeds warrant, fully anchored systems are preferable. For roofs where hybrid solutions can be accommodated (partially ballasted/anchored), array systems may, in these cases, incorporate a tie-down system that penetrates roofing in order to attach it to underlying roof frame members. </p>",,Minimum,Specifications,Array Type: Roof Mount,,Engineering; Safety,,All

</p>",,Minimum,Specifications,Array Type: Roof Mount,,Engineering,,All
115,Roof Warranties (Advanced),<p>This section provides guidance on how to include roof warranties into the contract</p>,"<p>Prior to the installation of the PV systems, the Contractor shall determine if a manufacturer and/or installer's warranty cover the existing roof system. If it is determined that the existing roof system is under a manufacturer's warranty, the Contractor shall engage the manufacturer representative and any other companies involved with service contracts or warranties regarding the PV system design, applied stresses, materials compatibility (chemical or physical), installation details and methods, and repairs to any damage to the roof during installation of the solar arrays. The Contractor shall provide manufacturer's shop drawings indicating the approved methods of installation in order to ensure the warranty remains in effect. The manufacturer's representative shall be allowed to provide oversight during the installation to ensure work is performed in accordance with approved methods. The Contractor shall provide documentation to the Contracting Officer (CO) demonstrating that the roof warranty has not been violated. The Contractor is to take no action leading to a voided roof warranty. 
</p><p>
Roofing companies often require an ""overburden waiver"" to ensure that the solar system will be removed if warranty repairs are required. This will ensure a watertight and structurally sound installation and ensure that the PV system does not void the manufacturer's warranty. 
</p><p>
The Contractor shall provide documentation to the Contracting Officer of the roofing manufacturer's recommendation, with resolutions obtained for the continuation of the roof warranties. It is preferable for the original roofing manufacturer and warranty holder(s) to provide this oversight; however, if not feasible, other roofing companies of similar qualifications and familiarity with the specific roof type and products may be engaged instead, with Governmental approval.

Once the roof replacement work is completed, the Contractor will restore the system to normal operation according to the output warranty schedule.
</p><p>
As part of the bid response, the Contractor shall provide the total cost of temporarily removing and restoring solar PV systems. The price provided by the Contractor in the bid response shall be for Year One (1).
</p><p>
For the year in which the roof replacement occurs, the Year One (1) bid price shall be inflated (compounded) using Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers to determine the current cost of the temporary removal and restoration.
</p><p>
The determination of the amount of energy that would have been produced during the relocation shall be based, during the first Contract Year, on the estimated levels of production and, after the first Contract Year, based on actual operation of the system in the same period in the previous Contract Year, unless Seller and Purchaser mutually agree to an alternative methodology. ""Contract Year"" means the 12-month period beginning at 12:00 AM on the Commercial Operation Date or on any anniversary of the Commercial Operation Date and ending at 11:59 PM on the day immediately preceding the next anniversary of the Commercial Operation Date, provided that the first Contract Year shall begin on the Commercial Operation Date.
</p><p>
The Contractor will have thirty (30) days from the written or verbal notice to restore the system to normal operation. If the system is not restored within one (1) month of roof replacement completion, the Government shall retain the services of a qualified solar PV firm, at Contractor expense.
</p><p>For third-party owned systems: If the Contractor fails to restore the system within the thirty (30)-day period, the Contractor shall not receive payment for lost electricity sales.</p><p>
The Contractor may be provided a staging area to store components on-site only if the room is available, as determined in coordination with Government site managers.

<p>If the PV system is to be installed in a WUI or HFPA, leading edge deflectors can be used to help slow the spread of flame (reducing chimney effect) and achieve a better fire rating. If the deflectors were used in the testing to achieve the fire rating, then they must be installed in order to maintain that rating.</p>

<p>It is highly recommended that the U.S. Forest Service's publication ""The 2010 Wildland-Urban Interface of the Conterminous United States"" be used to identify if the site is located in a WUI.

134,General Design Guidelines for Carports - Options for Layout,<p>This section describes general design guidelines that solar shaded carports must/can include.</p>,"<p>The shade structure shall utilize architectural measures (roof deck, gutters, downspouts) to prevent water from falling under or around the shade structure and forming areas of ice that can lead to slip-and-fall hazards. </p>","<p><strong>Solar Shaded Carport: Need for Watertight Structure</strong></p><p>
Costs for this type of watertight structure will be higher, due to the addition of roofing systems, gutters, downspouts, and the larger structural framing needed to support the added wind and weight loading. Depending on site conditions, there could be added costs to divert the rain captured by gutters to a site drainage system. In a worst-case scenario, a NEPA study might require the addition of a new site feature to manage storm water runoff coming from the shaded structures.
</p><p>
These structures provide a greater level of convenience by allowing users to enter and exit vehicles under a sheltered structure, and they also prevent snowmelt from dripping through and creating areas of ice and a fall hazard. Also, falling snow and ice that can shed from the structure must be considered. Make sure the design accounts for managing snow and ice slides, to prevent harm to individuals and property.
</p><p>
Gutters and downspouts may need to be kept clear of leafy debris. If so, this would add maintenance costs.
Broader site water management issues may arise, as the water that is shedding from the shade structure gutters will need to be managed according to applicable codes. This kind of structure could present a good opportunity for the installation of a rainwater capture system, providing for a water conservation opportunity. Rain barrels could also provide a source of emergency water supplies.
</p><p>
Precipitation will fall through the gaps between modules and provide no protection from rain, sleet, and snow. In cold climates, melting snow dripping through between the modules may refreeze on the parking lot surfaces below, presenting a serious fall hazard. However, in relatively dry and hot regions, this option could be perfectly acceptable, and provide highly valued and beneficial shade.
</p><p>
No Need for Watertight Structure: Shade Only Implications</p><p>
Solar-shaded carport structures present excellent opportunities to protect all kinds of Government equipment (e.g., boats, tractors, plows, large trucks, supplies) and/or fleet vehicles. Vehicles and equipment exposed to the elements have a shortened service life and higher maintenance costs.
</p><ol>
<li>For passenger cars and vans, ensure at least nine feet (9' ¬≤) of clearance at the lowest edge.</li>
<li>For larger vehicles and equipment, agency representatives should take careful measurements to set minimum height requirements based on the height of the vehicles and equipment to be stored under the structures.</li>
</ol><p>
Architectural or More Utilitarian Structure</p><p>
Consider relaxing the requirement to build architectural-grade structures in equipment yards that are out of view. This would be especially important for structures that are taller, made to accommodate large Government vehicles.
</p><p>
Other Critical Considerations</p><p>
Existing underground utilities running through or even nearby the parking lot are important for the Contractor to locate in advance.

147,EV Charger Ready for Shaded Carport Systems,<p>This section provides guidance on how solar shaded carports can be designed and constructed with low-cost measures to allow for easy future implementation of EV charging stations underneath the carports.</p>,"<p>Agencies seek to make designated parking spaces ""EV Charger Ready"" so that future installations of EV chargers (to be done by others under a separate effort) do not require retrenching of the parking lot paving. EV charger conduit will largely follow the same trench pathways used for the PV power cabling to the main service panel. To achieve an ""EV Charger Ready"" design, spare conduit for power and communications are to be added to trenches opened for the Solar PV project.  The Agency shall provide the number of and location of ""EV Ready"" parking stalls. </p>

<p>The following measures may be necessary to accommodate future chargers while avoiding retrenching and or reworking electrical switchgear.  The following factors shall be designed for and installed:</p>

     <ul><li>Spare conduit in number and size to accommodate the ampacity needed to support agency plans for charger locations.  To the greatest extent practical, EV charger conduit is to be placed in trenches opened for purposes of routing PV system wiring. 
     </li><li>Install pull strings and boxes necessary to install conductors at a later date.
     </li><li>If new breaker panel(s) are installed to support such project needs as interconnection or parking lot lighting, then panel sizing shall accommodate breakers needed for EV Level 2 chargers.
     </li><li>Pull box at or near the location of the proposed chargers at the head of the parking stalls designed as ""EV Charger Ready"" 
     </li><li>Pull boxes at or near the point of interconnection to the building service panel designed to supply future EV chargers</li></ul>
 
<p>For the purposes of this RFP, the Contractor shall assume parking stalls to be served by double-service, Level 2 EV (208/240V) chargers, with each charger requiring one (1) forty (40)-amp circuit served by a forty (40)-amp two-pole breaker. The Contractor shall install at a minimum one (1), one-inch electrical conduit for every two circuits or a larger conduit able to serve the number of required circuit conductors.</p>","<p>The installation of solar PV-shaded carport systems involves a great deal of underground trenching as a means to route array wiring and as a way to interconnect electrically with the main building service panel. The routing of array and system wiring is very close to that required to install electric vehicle chargers. Trenching to install underground conduit/wiring for EV chargers represents a large cost and inconvenience if not done along with the solar arrays. When agencies install solar PV-shaded carport systems, it is recommended that contractors be asked to install spare conduit in the open trenches as a means to enable the installation of electric vehicle chargers at a later date.
</p><p>
Designate stalls so Offerors know how many ""EV Ready"" parking spaces there will be, and where they will be located.
</p><p>
Agencies are now authorized and directed to establish EV charging stations for both fleet and personal use. The installation of solar shaded carports is an excellent opportunity to at the very least install the underground infrastructure needed. This allows agencies to come back at a convenient time and install the chargers needed.

Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), Pub. Law 114-94, H.R. Section 1413:
In December 2015, the FAST Act authorized agencies to install, operate, and maintain electric vehicle (EV) and plug-in electric vehicle (PIEV) charging equipment for employee use. The authority requires federal agencies to charge employees who use the charging station a fee to ensure that the federal agency recovers all of the costs in installing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the station.

In March 2015, President Obama signed Executive Order 13693 (E.O. 13693). Section 7(f) directs agencies to establish policies and programs for personal charging stations. The order requires that all applicable agency laws and regulations be complied with in consideration of establishing these charging stations. Agencies are also required to submit workplace-charging plans as part of the Strategic Sustainability Performance Plans (SSPP) starting in 2016. When the final plans are finalized, each agency must post the plans to their public websites.

</p><p>
The Government shall perform a ""best value analysis"" and the selection for award shall be made to the Offeror within the competitive range whose proposal is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government.  All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are equally important as cost or price.  In any case, the Government reserves the right to make award(s) to that Offeror whose proposal provides the best overall value to the Government.
</p><p>
Offerors are advised that the award will be made to that Offeror whose proposal provides the combination of features that offers the best or greatest overall value to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to the Government to achieve only slightly superior performance.  The overall cost to the Government may become the ultimate factor for award of a contract as proposals become more equal based on other factors.</p>",,Advanced,Selection Criteria,All,,Codes and Standards; Cybersecurity; Engineering; O&M; Resiliency; Safety; Severe Weather,,All
