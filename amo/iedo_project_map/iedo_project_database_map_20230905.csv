There are three principal objectives intended to (1) create sorption medium, and recover nutrients from the natural water;(2) improved water treatment using the composite photocatalysts to simultaneously oxidize As(III) and reduce U(UI) in contaminated wastewater and groundwater for drinking; and (3) media recycling through reductive dissolution. Research Tasks 1 through 3 (described below) map onto each of these scientific objectives (Task 1 and its subtasks are linked to objective 1 and so forth). These objectives and tasks are applicable to a variety of water contaminants common in rural areas, including, arsenic, uranium, nitrate and phosphate and others. Nitrate removal should be achieved alongside Fe oxidation in the media creation step. Arsenic, phosphate and uranium removal will be achieved by reaction with that media, although As and U removal will benefit from photocatalysts that can convert them to particle reactive forms.

Harvesting Energy from Wastewater by Converting Sewage Sludge to Renewable Natural Gas,Active,,42.28755,-71.83067,Advanced Water Resource Recovery Systems,Cross-Sector Technologies RD&D,Harvesting Energy from Wastewater by Converting Sewage Sludge to Renewable Natural Gas,Worcester Polytech          ,2000000,MA,10/1/2021,"Municipal treatment plants treat the overwhelming majority of wastewater in the U.S. Yet, wastewater treatment (WWT) remains energy intensive, consuming more than 30 TW-hr (0.1 quads) of electricity annually, and suffers from co-production of sewage sludge and/or biosolids that typically require landfill disposal. However, the energy content of water entering WWTPs is 5-times greater than the energy consumed in treatment. In addition to energy contained in organic compounds, the entering stream is rich in valuable inorganic components, specifically nitrogen and phosphorous, that are incompletely utilized. The overwhelming majority of the energy content along with much of the incoming nutrient content of wastewater is concentrated in the sludge and biosolid byproducts of WWT. This points to a clear opportunity to recover this energy and nutrient content, while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with landfilling the solid byproducts of WWT. The objective of this proposal is to establish a process for on-site recovery of the energy trapped in sewage sludge by rethinking hydrothermal gasification (HTG). For processing sewage sludge, HTG faces three major limitations: 1) it cannot handle high-solids feeds on its own, which limits thermal efficiency for non-soluble feeds such as sewage sludge, 2) the catalysts required for HTG are highly susceptible to sulfur poisoning and expensive and; 3) HTG does not maximize the value of incoming inorganic components, especially nitrogen and phosphorous. Similarly, the process must be made robust to handle changes in feed composition, since the properties of sewage sludge will vary based on location and over time. And, as a new technology, process simulation methods are required to make realistic economic and environmental projections of its performance at scale. Overcoming these limitations is the goal of this work. The project aims to address these limitations by a combination of innovative front-end processing, supercritical salt precipitation to recover nitrates and phosphates and remove sulfates from the process stream, and inexpensive and/or sulfur tolerant gasification catalysts. At the end of this project, the technology will be sufficiently de-risked for pilot-scale testing (2 dry tons per day of sewage sludge) at Genifuel’s demonstration site, located in Vancouver, CA.

",1981823,CO,9/1/2021,"This project combines two technology concept papers, both encouraged by the DOE for full proposal submission, into a single technology concept. The funding and success of this project will bring a technology to market long awaited by the U.S. wastewater industry as it holds promise to significantly lower energy costs while improving effluent quality. Aeration has the highest energy reduction potential in WRRFs, yet our industry has moved at a glacial pace towards aeration efficiency. This is primarily due to traditional beliefs that nitrification requires high DO conditions for stable process operation. However, our team members and other researchers have overturned this credo in recent years by independently demonstrating nitrogen removal under suboxic conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration less than 0.5 mg/L) at pilot-scale. Nevertheless, this has not moved into industry practice, as field application of suboxic nitrogen removal (SNR) requires a gradual microbial transition from high to low DO in the aeration basins. Reliable SNR hinges on a high degree of process control and stability that existing Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)-based aeration control systems in WRRFs are not designed for. Thus, WRRFs are rightfully worried about possible permit violations when lowering aeration for SNR. Model Predictive Aeration Control (MPAC) can overcome this barrier. This technology improves the accuracy of aeration control through real-time machine learning and predictive algorithms, which are responsive to the highly dynamic treatment conditions WRRFs experience daily. Since its first full-scale pilot implementation at the Chico WRRF in 2018, the DO/Nmaster MPAC technology developed by Ekster & Ass. brings the accuracy and reliability required to make SNR successful.",,"NewHub, Water Research Foundation, APG-Neuro, Ekster and Associates, Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, Columbia University, and University of Wisconsin",Advanced Water Resource Recovery Systems ,8/31/2024,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-awards-275-million-16-teams-working-decarbonize-us-water-infrastructure
