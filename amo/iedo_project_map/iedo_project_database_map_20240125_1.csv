The team will target the specific challenge of anode stability in the MSE process through this novel, molten anode approach to de-risk scale of up MSE ironmaking. MSE is an emerging alternative ironmaking process capable of reducing iron ore to useable metallic iron using only electricity instead of conventional carbon-based reductants. When combined with a renewable electricity source, MSE could enable deep decarbonization of the ironmaking portion in the steelmaking process, which is by far the most carbon intensive process step. The lower reaction temperatures in MSE compared with conventional blast furnace ironmaking and molten oxide electrolysis also offer potential energy intensity reductions. ",,,,,,

Harvesting Energy from Wastewater by Converting Sewage Sludge to Renewable Natural Gas,Active,,42.28755,-71.83067,Advanced Water Resource Recovery Systems,Cross-Sector Technologies,Harvesting Energy from Wastewater by Converting Sewage Sludge to Renewable Natural Gas,Worcester Polytech          ,2000000,MA,10/1/2021,"Municipal treatment plants treat the overwhelming majority of wastewater in the U.S. Yet, wastewater treatment (WWT) remains energy intensive, consuming more than 30 TW-hr (0.1 quads) of electricity annually, and suffers from co-production of sewage sludge and/or biosolids that typically require landfill disposal. However, the energy content of water entering WWTPs is 5-times greater than the energy consumed in treatment. In addition to energy contained in organic compounds, the entering stream is rich in valuable inorganic components, specifically nitrogen and phosphorous, that are incompletely utilized. The overwhelming majority of the energy content along with much of the incoming nutrient content of wastewater is concentrated in the sludge and biosolid byproducts of WWT. This points to a clear opportunity to recover this energy and nutrient content, while simultaneously reducing the costs associated with landfilling the solid byproducts of WWT. The objective of this proposal is to establish a process for on-site recovery of the energy trapped in sewage sludge by rethinking hydrothermal gasification (HTG). For processing sewage sludge, HTG faces three major limitations: 1) it cannot handle high-solids feeds on its own, which limits thermal efficiency for non-soluble feeds such as sewage sludge, 2) the catalysts required for HTG are highly susceptible to sulfur poisoning and expensive and; 3) HTG does not maximize the value of incoming inorganic components, especially nitrogen and phosphorous. Similarly, the process must be made robust to handle changes in feed composition, since the properties of sewage sludge will vary based on location and over time. And, as a new technology, process simulation methods are required to make realistic economic and environmental projections of its performance at scale. Overcoming these limitations is the goal of this work. The project aims to address these limitations by a combination of innovative front-end processing, supercritical salt precipitation to recover nitrates and phosphates and remove sulfates from the process stream, and inexpensive and/or sulfur tolerant gasification catalysts.

The most commonly used treatment technology today at U.S. water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs) is activated sludge (AS). The Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) configuration is the most common AS process for combined carbon and nitrogen removal. Although the MLE process is costly and energy intensive, it does not produce an effluent suitable for direct use in typical water reuse treatment processes. Consequently, WRRFs that have been upgraded to allow for water reuse often employ membrane bioreactor (MBR) technology. When WRRFs need expanded capacity but without the need for water reuse, upgrades often include moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR). While MBR/MBBR technologies are being increasingly utilized to update WRRFs, they are expensive and energy intensive. Alternatively, we propose a novel biomembrane filtration process to achieve an effluent suitable for discharge or input to water reuse technologies at reduced cost and energy relative to not only MBR and MBBR, but even relative to AS systems.",Steven Skerlos,"inCTRL Solutions, Suez Water Technologies & Solutions, and the City of Ann Arbor",Advanced Water Resource Recovery Systems ,9/30/2024,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-awards-275-million-16-teams-working-decarbonize-us-water-infrastructure

",1981823,CO,9/1/2021,"This project combines two technology concept papers, both encouraged by the DOE for full proposal submission, into a single technology concept. The funding and success of this project will bring a technology to market long awaited by the U.S. wastewater industry as it holds promise to significantly lower energy costs while improving effluent quality. Aeration has the highest energy reduction potential in WRRFs, yet our industry has moved at a glacial pace towards aeration efficiency. This is primarily due to traditional beliefs that nitrification requires high DO conditions for stable process operation. However, our team members and other researchers have overturned this credo in recent years by independently demonstrating nitrogen removal under suboxic conditions (i.e., dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration less than 0.5 mg/L) at pilot-scale. Nevertheless, this has not moved into industry practice, as field application of suboxic nitrogen removal (SNR) requires a gradual microbial transition from high to low DO in the aeration basins. Reliable SNR hinges on a high degree of process control and stability that existing Proportional Integral Derivative (PID)-based aeration control systems in WRRFs are not designed for. Thus, WRRFs are rightfully worried about possible permit violations when lowering aeration for SNR. Model Predictive Aeration Control (MPAC) can overcome this barrier. This technology improves the accuracy of aeration control through real-time machine learning and predictive algorithms, which are responsive to the highly dynamic treatment conditions WRRFs experience daily. Since its first full-scale pilot implementation at the Chico WRRF in 2018, the DO/Nmaster MPAC technology developed by Ekster & Ass. brings the accuracy and reliability required to make SNR successful.",,"NewHub, Water Research Foundation, APG-Neuro, Ekster and Associates, Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts, Columbia University, and University of Wisconsin",Advanced Water Resource Recovery Systems ,8/31/2024,,https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-awards-275-million-16-teams-working-decarbonize-us-water-infrastructure
