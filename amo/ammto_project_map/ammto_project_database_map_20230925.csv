The resulting lower cost for each implantation step, reduced capital cost of room-temperature implanters, and higher throughput in each implanter will accelerate the growth of SiC metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) for power electronics applications.

Although these methods prolong equipment life, fouling begins soon after the unit returns to service. Thus, the equipment is practically always performing at reduced efficiencies. There are two newer approaches to prevent fouling from occurring. One is surface coating, typically with a hydrophobic material that prevents adhesion of foulant. The other is to use physical/mechanical means, such as ultrasonic vibration, to remove/prevent deposition of foulant by dislodging them. Disadvantages of the current coating  echnologies include: a) decrease in heat transfer coefficient, since typically these coatings have low thermal conductivities, and b) degradation due to attrition/abrasion by suspended solid particles in the fluids, especially for the more effective but degradation-susceptible polymeric coatings that also have poor thermal stability.

The development of cathode inks represents the key technological task in this program as it enables us to evaluate two AM platforms in regard to the twin objectives of achieving high performance batteries and facile manufacturing. The cathode inks to be developed comprise three essential constituents: the electrochemically active material which undergoes redox reactions that store energy (LiFePO4); a conductive additive which increases electronic conductivity of the electrode and enhances charge-transfer reactions (a carbon-based material) and a polymer binder which ensures that the components are in good contact with each other. The research on inks focuses on the proper mixture of these constituents so that the printed electrode possesses the desired electrochemical properties. Thus, a fourth important aspect of the proposed work is the solvent phase of the ingredients that enables the ink to be printed by the additive manufacturing fabrication process. Both direct ink writing (DIW) and templating, the AM platforms in this program, rely on the development of electrochemical inks. These platforms have been shown to be successful methods for depositing electrochemical energy storage materials for traditional Li-ion batteries; they will now be applied to the three-dimensional (3D) array electrode configuration which forms the basis for the 2.5D battery. We are also attracted to these two platforms because of the prospect of achieving high volume, rapid production that requires relatively little capital equipment costs. In this way, the platforms avoid costly manufacturing limitations of micro-fabrication methods used in constructing the first generation 2.5D battery. Since different additive manufacturing techniques require different ink properties, two inks will be developed in parallel, one designed for direct ink writing (DIW) and one designed for templating methods. The principal outcomes of the program are to develop cathode inks, electrode arrays and other basic components of the 2.5D battery, assemble it into the desired battery architecture and determine its performance. This will be accomplished through the three interrelated tasks: (1) cathode ink development; (2) 3D printing of electrode structures; (3) 2.5D battery fabrication and testing.

By focusing on the blade internal structure, specifically the spar shear web, it is necessary to ensure that the additive manufactured (AM) structure can be integrated into the more conventional manufacturing processes used in the remainder of the wind blade production. When using conventional composite material laydown techniques, design relies on global ply orientations and current processes neither allow fibers to follow complex load paths in-plane or out-of-plane, limiting the mechanical performance. Additionally, structural cores, added between layers of reinforcement in the shear web of the wind blade to boost out-of-plane stiffness and buckling resistance, can be costly to procure and difficult to position and retain, in position, during processing. Alternatively, AM approaches can form the basis for processes which accurately produce, position and retain complex structural cores, resulting in reduced excess reinforcement material, and substantial weight and cost savings. Further, through incorporation of continuous reinforcement fiber, AM can offer a technical opportunity to develop alternative composite structures which overcome limitations in fiber positioning, can enable innovative composite structural designs that cannot be commercially manufactured by other means, and can be manufactured with a significant reduction in the amount of complex tooling.
