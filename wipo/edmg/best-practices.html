             <h1>Best Practices Research and Development</h1>
             <p>The <em>Energy Data Management Guide</em> focuses on solutions that have been replicated and that consistently produce positive results across diverse organizations.</p>
             <p>The organizations represent a variety of sizes, staff and financial resources, and geographic distribution, which makes the solutions applicable to organizations of all types. Some best practice solutions are from small cities with limited resources and staff. Although, diverse, all these entities share common goals for achieving cost reductions, greater energy efficiency, and accountability in day-to-day operations.</p>
             <p>Because this Guide focuses on proven strategies, it does not present innovative or emerging practices currently being developed by public sector organizations.</p>
             
             <h2>Methodology</h2>
             <p>A number of organizations interviewed for this Guide have partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy on the Better Buildings Challenge, a voluntary leadership program to reduce energy use of buildings by 20% over a 10-year period.  As part of this commitment, organizations are annually sharing facility-level energy use for their full portfolio of buildings.  In this way, Better Buildings Challenge partners are measuring and publicly tracking progress toward their energy reduction goal, and are able to make data-driven decisions on how to achieve their goal.  As of May 2018, the Better Buildings Challenge partners featured in this Guide have demonstrated average energy savings of approximately 2% a year with an overall average cumulative improvement of 14% compared to their respective baseline years.</p>
             
             <h2>Primary Research</h2>
             <p>The best practices identified in this Guide are based on primary research performed from 2013-2014 through in-depth interviews with more than 80 individuals from states, local governments, school districts, and industry experts from the federal government, private sector, and non-governmental organizations. In many instances, practitioners provided data and other materials to illustrate their approaches and evidence supporting their results. </p>
             <p>Interviewees included: </p>
             <ul>
              <li>State Energy Office representatives from 10 states</li>
              <li>Sustainability and Energy Managers from 25 local governments
                  <ul>
                   <li>13 large cities (portfolios of  &gt;120 buildings or  &gt;5 million SF)</li>
                   <li>7 medium sized cities and counties (portfolios between 50-120 buildings or 1-4 million SF)</li>
                   <li>5 small cities and counties (portfolios of  &lt; 50 buildings and  &lt;1.6 million SF) </li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Sustainability and Energy Managers from 5 school districts </li>
              <li>19 industry experts from the federal government, private sector, and non-governmental organizations</li>
             </ul>
             <p>The findings from the primary research are supplemented with published reports. Analysis of strategies includes examination of the relationships among various factors, such as organizational size, structure and utility landscape. Where possible, the size of the organization and its resources, staff, and budgetary constraints are addressed in order to provide solutions to as diverse an audience as possible.</p>
             
             <h2>Criteria</h2>
             <p>The following criteria were used to select a given solution as a best practice are outlined here:</p>
             
             <h3>Replication:</h3>
              <ul>
               <li>The solution has been successfully replicated by many practitioners</li>
               <li>The solution is feasible – not too complex, expensive or otherwise economically prohibitive </li>
               <li>The solution can be described and segmented into clear steps for implementation</li>
              </ul>
     
             <h3>Effectiveness:</h3>
              <ul>
               <li>The solution has been previously validated by many practitioners</li>
               <li>The solution generates benefits that justify the initial and ongoing investment in cost </li>
               <li>The solution generates qualitative and quantitative benefits to the organization  </li>
              </ul>
             
             <h3>Sustainability:</h3>
              <ul>
               <li>Benefits are sustainable over the long-term, resulting in continued buy-in from decision-makers</li>
              </ul>

             <h3>Impacts:</h3>
              <ul>
               <li>The solution addresses barriers to adopting energy efficiency practices</li>
               <li>The solution may be extended to other sectors and organizations</li>
              </ul>

             <h2>Metrics</h2>
             <p>Metrics were developed to compare and rank solutions on their level of effectiveness. A principal metric used was the energy and cost savings realized as a result of energy data management. Where applicable, secondary metrics were also used and include resource savings, operational efficiency, and time savings such as: </p>
             <ul>
              <li>Non-energy-related cost savings from utility bill analysis (e.g., reduction in utility bills due to a reduction of billing errors, late fees, etc.)</li>
              <li>Behavioral changes &mdash; staff engagement and compliance with energy tracking and savings initiatives</li>
              <li>Reduced time to diagnose energy waste and anomalies identified during energy data review and analysis</li>
              <li>More efficient operations that leverage resources and avoid redundancy in staff time and data entry and processing</li>
             </ul>
