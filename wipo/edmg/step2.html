		 <h1 id="0-1"><span>Step 2.</span> Align with Organizational Goals</h1>
    <p>Whether your energy data management effort starts from the staff-level or is directed from the top-down, you must make a strong value proposition to ensure executive leadership and stakeholders understand and are invested in its goals. To make the case for a continuous energy data management program, it is necessary to demonstrate how this activity can support and benefit the organization on many levels. Energy data champions can implement best practices to generate sustained buy-in for energy data management.</p>
    <h2 id="0-1-1">Identify and Engage Key Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>The success of an energy data management effort relies on effective engagement with key stakeholders. Even if leadership sets policies and provides the authority to begin a data management effort, it is critical to identify the stakeholders whose buy-in is needed to develop and execute this effort. Key stakeholders in this area include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Elected officials</li>
     <li>City and/or county managers and planners</li>
     <li>Energy and sustainability office directors and managers</li>
     <li>Finance department directors and staff</li>
     <li>Public works directors and other departments participating in the effort</li>
     <li>Facility managers and other &quot;on the ground&quot; staff responsible for executing the effort.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Identify all stakeholders and their roles in the energy data management effort:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Who will make decisions? </li>
     <li>Who may affect the effort's success through action or inaction? </li>
     <li>Which stakeholders control the budget and/or resources that may be needed to implement this effort? </li>
     <li>Which groups hold critical information? </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Map out how and when different stakeholders' input will be gathered, and what and how you will communicate with them and when.</p>
    <p>Once you identify key stakeholders, it is possible to formulate a data management effort that aligns with their goals and interests through a collaborative approach.  Treating stakeholders as partners and collaborators and listening to their input is a well-documented strategy for generating buy-in, creating a sense of ownership in the effort, and establishing broad support.</p>

		      	    <h8>A Collaborative Approach to the Development of an Energy Saving Strategy</h8>
                    <p>In response to rising utility expenditures, the City of Virginia Beach established a Joint Energy Committee (JEC) in 2008 to identify, assess, and implement energy-related activities.  The JEC is chaired by the Deputy City Manager, and comprises representatives from city departments, the City Public Schools, and the city’s major electric utility, Dominion Virginia Power.</p>

    <h2 id="0-1-2">Leverage Drivers and Motivators to Create Alignment</h2>
    <p>To align energy data management goals with the organization's broader needs, formulate the value proposition based on what particularly will drive and motivate stakeholders to respond.</p>
    <p>Drivers and motivators can include:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Rising energy expenditures</li>
     <li>Shrinking budgets</li>
     <li>Greater need for accountability</li>
     <li>A more efficient government</li>
     <li>Energy and greenhouse gas reduction goals</li>
     <li>Compliance with benchmarking laws and executive orders.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the end, more rigorous energy data tracking can better support all of these motivators. Stakeholders will engage more effectively if the data management effort addresses their immediate needs.</p>
    <p>In many cases, you can present the anticipated benefits to the top leadership as an attractive initiative that will result in positive recognition for the organization. Crafting the value proposition involves raising awareness about factors that contribute to waste, depleting energy budgets, or increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the value proposition, you can address all factors such as:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Changes in energy demand</li>
     <li>How utility rate trends impact budgets</li>
     <li>The organization's performance relative to its goals</li>
     <li>A review of existing policies to determine their efficacy. </li>
    </ul>

		      	    <h8>Creating Sustainability in America’s Energy Capital</h8>
                    <p>Building on the city’s goals and principles of fiscal responsibility, Gillette’s Sustainability Manager addressed the city’s values and goals when engaging the city’s decision makers to generate buy-in for implementing new sustainability initiatives. When considering new initiatives, the sustainability manager identified that lowering operating costs in city-owned buildings was well-aligned with the city’s goal and therefore this would be an attractive value proposition to the City Council.</p>

    <h2 id="0-1-3">Develop a Vision of Success</h2>
    <p>To encourage support and participation in the data management effort, staff must understand how their department and entire organization will benefit. It can be difficult to convey these benefits because the actual activities that underlie energy management are operational and may only indirectly serve the organization's mission. So, staff may not view them as priorities.</p>
    <p>To avoid this, you must develop a strong and compelling vision of success that speaks to the:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>General mission of the organization in terms of the reasons for the initiative</li>
     <li>Results that can be expected if successful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These benefits can be conveyed to staff in terms such as &quot;Through this effort we will achieve&hellip;&quot; and &quot;This is how you, as an individual, team, or department, benefit from this effort.&quot;  Breaking it down helps generate the buy-in and ensures understanding, at least on a basic level. </p>

		      	    <h8>Making the Value Proposition for Engaging a Third-Party Service Provider</h8>
                    <p>The energy manager at Portland Public Schools realized that the demands of tracking energy significantly limited his time to manage and improve the performance of facilities under his purview and developed a value proposition that clearly lays out the costs and benefits of implementing a new data management solution.</p>

    <h2 id="0-1-4">Cultivate Strong Allies</h2>
    <p>To enhance the value proposition and increase credibility during the initial stages, identify key allies that are willing to be partners or lend support to the new effort, especially when building the effort from the bottom up. You can advance the initiative by leveraging resources, early successes, and political buy-in.</p>
    <p>In addition, a significant number of sustainability directors and energy managers have successfully generated buy-in for aggressive, energy-reduction goals and tracking energy consumption by persuading leadership to join a national initiative, such as the <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/challenge">U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Challenge</a>. Joining a larger effort supported by a variety of industry partners enables leadership to recognize that partnering with other organizations increases their chances of success. </p>
    
    <h2 id="0-1-5">Start with Small Steps</h2>
    <p>If energy data management is not your leadership's top priority, you can jump start the initiative by taking incremental steps that demonstrate its value. You can make a case for expanding the data management effort when initial activities lead to measurable and quick results. This is when capturing low-hanging fruit can be an effective strategy at demonstrating the feasibility of achieving real energy and cost savings. For example, a utility bill audit on a subset of large accounts is likely to identify cost-saving opportunities that will engage the interest of leadership and stakeholders.</p>
    <p>Another powerful tool is developing a showcase project. You can use it to build credibility and demonstrate the value of the energy data management effort. You will provide a compelling rationale for continued efforts by implementing and demonstrating quick-payback, energy efficiency improvements using actual and verified data.</p>
    <p>To demonstrate a project's value, it's important to obtain baseline data to show the before and after energy usage and costs. Communicating additional benefits such as improved occupant comfort, worker productivity, or compliance with indoor air quality standards can also be an effective way to generate buy-in and support. </p>
    
    <h2 id="0-1-6">Anticipate Barriers and Provide Support to Stakeholders</h2>
    <p>At the beginning, not all stakeholders will be supportive. It may take some time for them to recognize the effort's value. Certain stakeholders may view energy data tracking as intrusive and will be reluctant to participate and share information. Others may not view it as a priority; they'll simply delay taking action or delivering the requested information. In these cases, your best option is to work with what is available and be persistent with stakeholders. As the effort progresses, demonstrated successes will generate support from those whom were initially reluctant or slow to join the effort.</p>
    <p>Smart implementation can be the crux of any energy data management effort. Some stakeholders may require additional support and guidance to adequately fulfill their role in the process. Training and specific tools can make a significant difference as to whether stakeholders are willing and able to contribute to the program's success.  To assist in this effort, you can leverage non-profit and governmental organizations for free resources and staff training.</p>
