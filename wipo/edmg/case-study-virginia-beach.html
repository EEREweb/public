             <h1>City of Virginia Beach, Virginia: A Collaborative Approach to the Development of an Energy-Saving Strategy</h1>
             
             <p>The City of Virginia Beach's soaring utility expenditures, which reached a peak of approximately $22.8 million in 2012 and represented a $4 million increase since fiscal year 2010, prompted the city to get a better handle on utility expenditures. <sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup></p>
             
             <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
             
             <p>In response to rising utility expenditures, the City of Virginia Beach established a Joint Energy Committee (JEC) in 2008 to identify, assess, and implement energy-related activities. The JEC is chaired by the Deputy City Manager, and comprises representatives from city departments, the City Public Schools, and the city's major electric utility, Dominion Virginia Power.</p>
             
             <p>In 2008, the JEC set a goal to reduce electricity use in city buildings by 10% from a 2007-2008 fiscal year baseline by 2013. <sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup> To help the city achieve these savings, the JEC decided to increase the efficiency of the city's bill processing and payment system by automating bill processing.</p>
             
             <p>To execute the plan, the JEC established a project team consisting of members of the energy Office, and the Finance, Public Works, and IT Departments. The Energy Manager was responsible for overseeing the transition to electronic invoicing via electronic data interchange (EDI) from project initiation through implementation. Because the solution involved development of new IT interfaces with outside vendors, the project required close collaboration between key city staff and outside vendors to integrate the new system and meet the city's project specifications.</p>
             
             <h3>Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
               <ul>
                <li>The energy manager led the project from initiation through implementation</li>
                <li>The procurement buyer negotiated energy software procurements</li>
                <li>IT staff managed the project and analysis, developed the interface specifications and the interface to the financial application, and deployed the software on the city's network</li>
                <li>The vendors implemented and customized the software to meet the city's specifications. </li>
                <li>The finance lead and staff in accounts payable tested user acceptance during the final phases of the project</li>
               </ul>
             
             <p>The Finance Department was a critical partner in this initiative. The team included a financial analyst that successfully implemented the integration of the new software. This analyst also led the testing team &mdash; which identified and fixed many &quot;bugs&quot; before the system went live. </p>
             
             <h2>Key Success Factors</h2>
               <ul>
                <li>City-wide policy to improve operations through electronic payment processing</li>
                <li>Participation of key utility partner in the Joint Energy Committee</li>
                <li>Involvement of leadership and key partners from the early stages of strategy development (Finance, IT, and Public Works' building maintenance)</li>
                <li>Close collaboration with participating departments to understand programmatic needs and test new software solution.</li>
               </ul>
