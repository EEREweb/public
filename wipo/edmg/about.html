	  	<h1>About the Guide</h1>
             
        <p>The Energy Data Management Guide provides public sector organizations with a seven step approach to establish a robust and sustainable energy data management programâ€”the foundation for strategic energy management. By following the best practices outlined in the guide's seven step framework, organizations will cut energy waste, save taxpayer dollars, demonstrate leadership, improve the efficiency of operations, and create a culture of accountability and high performance.</p>
        <h2>Purpose and Background</h2>
        <p>The guide's purpose is to:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Assist organizations in developing the value proposition they can bring to their executives and leadership to invest in data-driven energy management</li>
         <li>Provide evidence-based solutions for strategic energy management that are broadly replicable and applicable to other public sector organizations</li>
         <li>Help organizations chart a feasible energy data management strategy based on these solutions</li>
         <li>Serve as a how-to guide for implementation of these solutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The best practices in the guide evolved from in-depth interviews conducted in 2013-2014 with more than 80 individuals from states, local governments, school districts, and industry experts from the federal government, private sector, and non-governmental organizations. Learn more about the <a href="best-practices.html">Best Practice Methodology</a>. On average, research shows these organizations are achieving sustained energy savings of 2% a year. Learn more about the individuals and organizations that were interviewed and reviewed the guide, see &lt;LINK TO&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/A&gt;.</p>
        <p>The results from that research, plus the supplemental flowcharts, tips, templates, tools, examples highlighted throughout the guide, provide replicable solutions to help public sector organizations implement or refine a data-driven strategic energy management program.</p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>The Energy Data Management Guide is targeted to public sector officials from states, local governments, and K-12 school districts responsible for managing energy and/or energy using assets in their organizations.</p>
        <h2 id="opportunity">Opportunity</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>50 States, 77,000 local governments, and 13,000 public school districts in the U.S. [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</li>
         <li>State governments spend more than $11 billion annually on energy, which can account for as much as 10% of a typical government's annual operating budget. [<a href="#ref2">2</a>]</li>
         <li>Currently, more than $300 Billion leave American cities and towns to pay energy bills each year. [<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</li>
         <li>State and local governments own 18 billion square feet of building space [<a href="#ref4">4</a>], and there are approximately 98,000 public schools in the U.S. [<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</li>
         <li>State and local government buildings consume 3,075 trillion Btus (source energy) annually. [<a href="#ref6">6</a>]</li>
         <li>State and local government spend more than $28 billion [source energy use x 2016 blended unit energy costs from EIA] annually on energy costs (source energy) [3,075 trillion x 2016 blended unit energy costs from EIA] in buildings. </li>
         <li>Buildings benchmarked in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager showed average energy savings of 2.4% per year. [<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</li>
         <li>The average commercial building wastes 30 percent of the energy it consumes. [<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Impacts</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>If all state and local government buildings were benchmarked and saved at least 2.4% annually, the resulting energy and cost savings would be approximately 74 trillion Btu [2.4% x 3,075 trillion Btus] and $686 million [73.80 trillion Btus X 2016 blended unit energy costs from EIA] per year.</li>
         <li>A 30% improvement in state and local government buildings can deliver an estimated 920 trillion Btu [30% x 3,075 trillion Btus] and $8.6 billion in annual savings [922 trillion Btus X 2016 blended unit energy costs from EIA].</li>
