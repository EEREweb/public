		<h1>City of Gillette, Wyoming: Creating Sustainability in America's Energy Capital</h1>
             <p>The City of Gillette, Wyoming, is the seat of Campbell County, and the self-proclaimed energy capital of the nation where approximately 30% of U.S. coal is produced. While energy is abundant and relatively low cost, one of the city's goals is to demonstrate to its citizens, utility customers, and neighboring communities that the city government is a good steward of taxpayer funds and natural resources.<a href="#ref1"><sup>i</sup></a></p>
             <p>While the city has engaged in various energy efficiency and sustainability efforts over the years, an opportunity to significantly expand these efforts presented itself in 2012, with the launch of the Better Buildings Initiative, part of which encouraged building owners to track energy consumptions and reduce energy use in buildings by 20% by the year 2020. </p>
    
        <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
             <p>The Sustainability Manager approached the council to propose that the City of Gillette join this national initiative.Â  Building on the city's goals and principles of fiscal responsibility, the city's Sustainability Manager addressed the city's values and goals when engaging the city's decision makers to generate buy-in for implementing new sustainability initiatives. When considering this new initiative, the sustainability manager identified that lowering operating costs in city-owned buildings was well-aligned with the city's goal and therefore this would be an attractive value proposition to the City Council.</p>
             <p>Strategies for generating buy-in across the organization:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Identify leadership's drivers and goals</li>
                 <li>Create and frame solutions that address these goals</li>
                 <li>Foster teamwork and collaboration across the city's participating divisions</li>
                 <li>Develop a process that integrates energy management into procurement decision-making</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Following multiple meetings and presentations to the City Council, Gillette took a major step in its efforts to reduce energy use by joining the DOE's Better Buildings Challenge. As part of this program, Gillette has committed to a 20% reduction in energy use across the portfolio of city buildings and became the first local government in Wyoming to join this initiative.<a href="#ref2"><sup>ii</sup></a></p>
        
        <h2>Outcomes</h2>
             <p>By carefully crafting the value proposition to leadership, the Sustainability Division has elevated its relevance and visibility with decision makers. The sustainability initiatives are helping the city become more fiscally responsible by incorporating energy efficiency and anticipating funding needs and planning appropriately. Additionally, the process drove improved internal communication and teamwork among the participating divisions. The Sustainability Division now regularly takes part in procurement decision-making.</p>
