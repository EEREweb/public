		<h1 id="0-1"><span>Step 1:</span> Define the Merits of Tracking Energy Data</h1>
	    <p>Organizations that have established robust energy data management programs report benefits in three areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Energy and cost savings</li>
          <li>Enhanced goal setting</li>
          <li>Improved control of energy budgets.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Energy data management begins with consistent monitoring of energy consumption through energy data tracking, which is a continuous process of data collection and measurement. Data is used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assess the performance of buildings and other assets in a portfolio </li>
          <li>Set realistic goals</li>
          <li>Identify opportunities for improvement</li>
          <li>Verify results of energy reduction efforts</li>
          <li>Monitor trends </li>
          <li>Measure success </li>
          <li>Reassess or revaluate your goals  </li>
        </ul>
        <p>See the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) State and Local Solution Center to <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/access-and-use-energy-data">learn about accessing and using energy data</a>.</p>
      
		<h2 id="0-1-1">Energy and Cost Savings</h2>
      	<p>Growing evidence shows that tracking energy use in buildings is associated with sustained energy savings.</p>
		<p>An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) analysis of 35,000 buildings shows organizations that benchmark their buildings consistently in ENERGY STAR<sup>&reg;</sup>Portfolio Manager have achieved an average increase in their ENERGY STAR score of 2 points per year.</p>
		<p>Similarly, public sector organizations that have voluntarily joined the Better Buildings Challenge and track facility-level energy use have on average reduced portfolio-wide energy use intensity by more than 2% annually.</p>
		<p>Resultant cost savings can benefit a financially constrained organization.  For example, school districts have benefited by reducing energy costs and using the funds to retain teachers. Local governments have also benefited by using the savings to retain staff and maintain adequate city services, such as safety and fire protection.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
            <h5><span class="sector k12"></span>&nbsp;Energy Data Analysis Results in Significant Cost Savings</h5>
			<p>After examining energy use data to identify cost saving options, Davenport Community School District in Iowa carried out projects that resulted in $1.2 million in reduced energy costs, which were then used to fund 20 teacher positions.</p>
	    </section>
		<p class="topmargin">When you reinvest a portion of the savings in a dedicated, internal energy fund for financing efficiency projects, you'll have funding available for additional projects. In turn, these projects will generate additional savings down the road.</p>
		
		<h3 id="0-1-1-1">Be Proactive with Energy Management</h3>
		<p>Organizations better position themselves to identify and prioritize energy management activities through benchmarking of consumption and costs. This helps them identify low performers and opportunities for improvement.</p>
		<p>Energy data provides building owners and managers with the information they need to make informed decisions about system optimization and energy efficiency investments.  Proactive energy management entails timely collection of comprehensive energy consumption data, which allows for quick response to issues such as usage anomalies, thereby avoiding costs related to energy waste.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
			<h5><span class="sector local"></span>&nbsp;Leveraging Utility Billing Data Reduces Water Costs</h5>
			<p>The City of San Bernardino, California, leveraged utility billing data to determine that a pump system for a public lake was malfunctioning. San Bernardino’s billing oversight process flagged a bill for $15,000, which was normally around $500. The pump system repairs cost about $50,000 – approximately the amount the city would have poured into water payments every three months had the pump system not been repaired.</p>
		</section>
		
		<h3 id="0-1-1-2">Operate Efficiently</h3>
		<p>A well-structured data collection and tracking effort can serve multiple business units within an organization by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reducing redundancy</li>
			<li>Allowing staff to devote more time to managing</li>
			<li>Executing energy and cost savings strategies.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Significant time and effort is spent on processing bills, and it is not uncommon to have billing errors and late fees that add unnecessary, avoidable costs. The energy management service provider ENGIE Insight (formerly Ecova) reports that over 9% of utility accounts have missing or late invoices, and up to 6% of client invoices are reissued by utilities.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
			<h5><span class="sector local"></span>&nbsp;Electronic Bill Processing Decreases Staff Time and Costs</h5>
			<p>When the City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, transitioned to electronic bill processing, it eliminated approximately 12,000 paper invoices annually, and as a result, staff time required to track and pay bills was reduced from 160 hours per month to an average of 20 hours per month, equivalent to an 85% decrease. Invoice processing time was also significantly reduced.</p> 
		</section>

		<h3 id="0-1-1-3">Design and Verify Energy Efficiency Projects</h3>
		<p>Easily accessible data allows an organization to pull together the requisite energy data for:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Planning energy efficiency projects</li>
			<li>Designing projects</li>
			<li>Writing proposals</li>
			<li>Applying for programs and available incentives.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The ability to quantify savings associated with energy conservation measures can complement the measurement and verification of energy consumption and savings obtained through contracts with energy savings companies (ESCOs). In addition, easily accessible data allows organizations to more easily apply and qualify for energy efficiency rebates and grants.</p> 
		
      	<h2 id="0-1-2">Enhanced Energy Goal Setting</h2>
		<p>Your organization can significantly increase its chances of success by setting energy reduction targets based on past performance. Tracking progress towards set goals is critical for determining whether adjustments need to be made to the strategy. Reaching a goal provides an organization with a tangible result that can be used as recognition for implementing a proactive cost-savings strategy and as a responsible steward of public funds. Together, these practices help build a culture of continuous improvement and accountability.</p>
		
	  	<h3 id="0-1-2-1">Set Achievable Targets and Track Progress</h3>
		<p>You can use past performance trends as useful benchmarks for setting concrete and achievable targets. Tracking performance data provides visibility into the actual energy and cost savings achieved through projects and initiatives. This allows the organization to make more accurate estimates of future savings. </p>
		<p>By tracking monthly energy consumption against benchmarks, you can evaluate progress toward goals and the effectiveness of energy efficiency projects and programs, enabling a quicker response to issues. This feedback will allow you to adjust strategies if energy savings are less than expected.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
			<h5><span class="sector state"></span>&nbsp;Using Data Analytics to Achieve Energy Goals</h5>
			<p>Data analytics is the first of four core strategies that the State of New York is implementing to achieve a 20% energy reduction in energy performance at state-owned and managed facilities through BuildSmart NY. The Smart Analytics approach leverages benchmarking, reporting, data management, social media and sub-metering to help agencies manage their energy use in ways never before possible.</p> 
		</section>

  	  	<h3 id="0-1-2-2">Receive Recognition for High Performance and Leadership</h3>
		<p>Setting and reaching a measurable goal provides an organization with tangible results that it can use to communicate cost savings and responsible stewardship of public funds. Your organization can receive recognition for high performance and leadership by participating in regional and national initiatives that recognize government leadership and innovation.</p>
		<p>If one or more of your buildings qualify for <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/earn-recognition/energy-star-certification">ENERGY STAR certification</a>, you can use it as another way to increase the visibility of energy efficiency efforts. By benchmarking buildings and obtaining a score, you can strategically prioritize projects and raise scores to demonstrate leadership in your community.</p>
		<p>The <a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/challenge">DOE Better Buildings Challenge</a> also provides national recognition to public sector organizations for achieving energy goals, and applying innovative energy solutions. </p>
		
		<h3 id="0-1-2-3">Develop a Culture of Accountability and High Performance</h3>
		<p>Performance tracking increases accountability and incentivizes continuous improvement. It allows organizations to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Build on past successes</li>
          <li>Set more ambitious goals</li>
          <li>Adopt innovative strategies to foster more efficient operations and improved fiscal responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An increasing number of public-sector organizations are expanding data tracking to a larger proportion of their buildings and facilities, and to a wider set of commodities and services such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Water</li>
          <li>Fuel</li>
          <li>Solid waste management</li>
          <li>Other services. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can even apply the benefits of data tracking and analysis to other parts of your organization. </p>

		<h2 id="0-1-3">Improved Control and Transparency of Energy Budgets</h2>
		<p>Transparency drives awareness and engagement in the energy data management process. It allows for a review of how an organization utilizes taxpayer resources. A comprehensive and robust energy data management program facilitates oversight and reporting of energy budgets and expenditures.</p>

		<h3 id="0-1-3-1">Optimize Utility Tariffs</h3>
		<p>A periodic review of utility bills and contracts can also lead to savings from utility tariff adjustments.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
			<h5>Utility Bill Reviews Result in Savings from Tariff Adjustments</h5>
			<p><span class="sector local"></span>&nbsp;Working with a consultant to audit historical consumption information, the City of Houston, Texas, recovered $215,000 due to inaccurate utility tariff rates.</p>
			<p><span class="sector k12"></span>&nbsp;The Poudre School District in Fort Collins, Colorado, has achieved $50,000 in annual savings by adjusting rate schedules, which was possible because the energy manager had access to accurate historical consumption information.</p> 
			<p><span class="sector local"></span>&nbsp;The City of Columbus, Ohio, optimized natural gas rates in its large buildings resulting in enough savings to pay the yearly salary of the Energy Manager.</p> 
		</section>
				
		<h3 id="0-1-3-2">Recover Costs from Billing Errors</h3>
		<p>The ability to review utility data facilitates periodic utility account audits, which can recover erroneous utility payments. You can avoid billing errors&mdash;such as overcharges, double billing, and billing on closed accounts&mdash;through consistent tracking and monitoring of utility billing data.</p>
		<p>In addition, careful oversight of utility bills can reduce recurring monthly charges and late fees that, overtime, can contribute to significant unnecessary costs.</p>
		<hr>
	    <section class="stepgroup">
			<h5>Utility Bill Analysis Recovers Costs from Errors</h5>
			<p><span class="sector state"></span>&nbsp;Detailed utility billing analysis by the State of Maryland revealed a $91,000 electronic billing error.</p>
			<p><span class="sector state"></span>&nbsp;During a comprehensive rate appropriateness review, the State of North Carolina examined all of its meters, which led to discovering bills received and paid for serviced buildings the state no longer owned or occupied. As a result, the state recovered more than $500,000 in erroneous charges from the new tenants.</p>
			<p><span class="sector local"></span>&nbsp;The City of Virginia Beach identified numerous accounts for which it paid a monthly charge but for which power usage was zero. Closing these accounts avoided the city future costs.</p>  
		</section>

      <h3 id="0-1-3-3">Facilitate Demand Response, Energy Planning and Purchasing</h3>
	  <p>A comprehensive energy data management approach can help your organization weather energy price fluctuations, particularly in deregulated markets. Energy costs can fluctuate widely, although average electricity prices are projected to remain relatively flat out to 2050.</p>
        <p>Having all consumption and rate information in one central location helps facilitate:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Energy planning</li>
          <li>Demand response programs</li>
          <li>Energy purchasing decisions in deregulated markets. </li>
        </ul>
      <p>A critical component of smooth operations and energy management includes the ability to forecast and budget for future energy demand and equipment replacement.</p>
